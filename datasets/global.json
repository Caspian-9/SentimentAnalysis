Hospitalizations remain high, with 13 people in hospital, eight people in intensive care units and six people on ventilators. A new outbreak has been declared at J.G. Simcoe Public School, with three active cases as of Wednesday. Also on Wednesday, at a board of health meeting, Dr. Piotr Oglaza implemented new restrictions that would have 12- to 17-year-olds show vaccination certificates in order to play sports in indoor settings. Oglaza said that adding restrictions to other public places would not be the best course of action at this moment, since the majority of transmission is happening in private settings, like individual households. Half of the region\u2019s cases are being caught through close contact, while about 20 per cent of cases have no known transmission. The medical officer of health also noted that so far, about 43,000 people in the KFL&A region remain not fully vaccinated, and urged those who can get their shots to do so."},

The Alberta government announced its plans Tuesday to make the pediatric Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine available to children 5-11. Parents and guardians could start booking vaccination appointments Wednesday at 8 a.m. and the first appointments will be Friday. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cIf your child was recently immunized with another vaccine, such as influenza, it is also recommended to wait 14 days before having your child receive the pediatric COVID vaccine,\u201d Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said. \u201cThis is a precaution. While we\u2019ve seen with older age groups taking other vaccines with the COVID vaccine, this has been safe and effective, however this spacing for 5-11 year olds is recommended to allow us to watch more closely for any potential adverse effects.\u201d For Cheryl Fix, that meant pushing back her son\u2019s first COVID-19 dose. He came home from school on Tuesday and said he\u2019d just received his   at school that day. Fix said she had consented to her son receiving his routine immunizations but didn\u2019t know when they\u2019d be given. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what part of the month or what season they did those vaccines,\u201d she said. \u201cI actually assumed they\u2019d be in the spring. So I was a bit surprised. \u201cWe were really excited to get him registered this morning for his COVID vaccine. And then, of course, realized when we read the paper \u2014 they\u2019re actually on the site \u2014 it says when you\u2019re registering that there should be a period of two weeks, so we had to postpone. \u201cI was trying to book them right away. So we postponed it for actually about two-and-a-half weeks into December to get his first COVID shot.\u201d While she was hoping to get her son fully vaccinated before Christmas, Fix is just grateful he\u2019s now eligible to be immunized. \u201cI\u2019m really very pleased that the COVID vaccine got approved early,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting it honestly until March, or at least until the spring. So even having some protection with the first level of vaccine before we have (what) probably will still be a smaller Christmas than regular, at least it gives me some comfort.\u201d Still, if she had been given a bit of advance notice, Fix might have prioritized her son getting his COVID-19 vaccine over the other shots, at least temporarily. \u201cIf I could have figured out how to do the COVID vaccine, I might have done that first,\u201d Fix said. \u201cI\u2019m okay to wait. I was a little surprised because I was very anxious and excited to get it done sooner. But I\u2019d rather us follow the right health guidelines to make sure that he\u2019s not affected negatively in any way\u2026 I would rather go by what the health officials say around the right amount of time in between.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Fix understands the health system is slammed right now and she\u2019s impressed it\u2019s able to continue with routine childhood vaccines while coordinating the pediatric COVID-19 rollout at a moment\u2019s notice. \u201cI\u2019m amazed that public health can do all of this at the same time,\u201d she said. \u201cMy hat\u2019s off to them to get all these vaccines \u2014 the regular ones, the routine ones, the COVID ones \u2014 out. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine how difficult it is. But I actually think it\u2019s good that they continued on with the routine vaccines for kids\u2026 I think not postponing things like that is critical.\u201d She also praised her son\u2019s school for keeping parents informed throughout the pandemic. The Edmonton Catholic School District said it\u2019s striving for even more effective communication. \u201cSchools are notified in advance of AHS immunization clinics. We provide the venue for the clinics and communicate dates with families on behalf of AHS through school newsletters or calendars,\u201d spokesperson Christine Meadows said. \u201cWe are working to find out what happened in this case, to ensure more effective communication going forward.\u201d A division spokesperson said Edmonton Public Schools \u201cpartners with Alberta Health Services (public health unit) to deliver immunization clinics in our division schools. Each school works directly with Alberta Health Services as part of our site-based decision-making model. \u201cAlberta Health Services is the lead on student immunization clinics, including communication with parents and timing of clinics in schools,\u201d Megan Normandeau explained in an email. Global News has reached out to Alberta Health Services for comment. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Hinshaw said Tuesday that clinical trial data shows the Pfizer pediatric vaccine is 90.7 per cent effective in preventing COVID-19 in children and no serious side effects were reported. She said more than two million doses have already been administered to children 5-11 in the U.S., with few adverse effects and no safety signals reported. The pediatric dose is one-third of the dose given to people 12 and older, she said, and the immune response in children 5-11 is comparable to that in adults. In the past 120 days, 13.4 per cent of all COVID-19 cases in Alberta were in children 5-11, Hinshaw said Tuesday. Of those, 26 required hospitalization, including three who were treated in ICU, she said. Hinshaw encouraged parents or guardians with questions about vaccines and children to speak to a health professional. A telephone town hall will be held next Tuesday to provide additional information and answer questions. Alberta Health said as of 4 p.m. Wednesday, 49,618 pediatric vaccine appointments had been booked online. The province has said about 391,000 Alberta children are eligible."},

The Kececi family could not wait for their 11-year-old son Karan to get the COVID vaccine, and were among the first to book an appointment when they became available Tuesday morning. Karan said he was nervous going in, but his fears quickly went away. \u201cIt felt like nothing,\u201d he said after his shot.

Some younger children screamed and cried in fear as they got their shots, but the vaccinators came prepared.

Eleven-year-old Mika-Ella Varin was happy to get the shot so she can travel again. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to go, like, on vacation a lot,\u201d she said, explaining she was looking forward to going back to New York City. A few other families with young children talked about being able to travel to their home countries in Europe again. Public health officials are more excited about limiting outbreaks in schools. \u201cWe know right now, there are a lot of outbreaks in schools,\u201d said Le Guerrier. \u201cChildren have to be isolated, the brothers and sisters have to be in quarantine, the parents have to miss work. Getting children vaccinated is going to be good for all of those psychosocial issues.\u201d Le Guerrier says the smaller dose kids get should lead to less side effects compared to the adult dose, that it\u2019s safe and 91-per cent effective protecting children from COVID-19, and that getting this age group vaccinated is the next step toward putting the pandemic behind us."},

{"title": "2nd COVID-19 case of unknown origin reported in California - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted February 28, 2020 6:38 pm", "body": "California health officials on Friday confirmed the second case of novel coronavirus in the United States believed to have been transmitted to a person who didn\u2019t travel internationally or come in close contact with anyone who had it. Health officials in San Jose said the patient was an older adult woman with chronic health conditions who does not have a travel history or any known contact with a traveler or infected person. It comes a day after state officials said a woman hospitalized at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento had contracted the illness after no known contact. \u201cThis new case indicates that there is evidence of community transmission, but the extent is still not clear,\u201d said Dr. Sara Cody, health officer for Santa Clara County and director of the County of Santa Clara Public Health Department. Officials were able to get quick confirmation because the test was done by the Santa Clara County Public Health Laboratory with test kits received from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Officials submitted the woman\u2019s specimens for testing Thursday and received the results Thursday night. The California Department of Public Health said Friday that the state will receive enough kits from the CDC to test up to 1,200 people, a day after Gov. Gavin Newsom complained to federal health officials that the state had already exhausted its initial 200 test kits. State official also said the federal government decided it will not need to use the Fairview Developmental Center in Orange County to isolate passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. That\u2019s because of the imminent end of the isolation period for those passengers and the relatively small number of persons who ended up testing positive, officials said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The CDC had originally estimated that as many as half the passengers would test positive. But the state said the actual number has been \u201csubstantially lower.\u201d A federal judge had granted officials in Costa Mesa a temporary restraining order blocking the transfers during the time when state officials said the facility had been \u201ccritically needed.\u201d Cody said the newly confirmed case in Santa Clara County is not linked to two previous cases in that county, nor to others in the state. The Santa Clara County resident was treated at a local hospital and is not known to have traveled to Solano County, where public health officials have identified dozens of people \u2014 but less than 100 \u2014 who had close contact with the case announced Thursday. They are quarantined in their homes. and a few who have shown symptoms are in isolation, officials said. At UC Davis Medical Center, at least 124 registered nurses and other health care workers were sent home for \u201cself-quarantine\u201d after the woman with the virus was admitted, National Nurses United, a nationwide union representing RNs, said Friday. \u201cDespite University of California medical facilities being generally better prepared and equipped to treat challenging medical cases, the \u2026 case highlights the vulnerability of the nation\u2019s hospitals to this virus,\u201d the union said. The case of the infected women marks an escalation of the worldwide outbreak in the U.S. because it means the virus could spread beyond the reach of preventative measures like quarantines, though state health officials said that was inevitable and that the risk of widespread transmission remains low. California public health officials on Friday said more than 9,380 people are self-monitoring after arriving on commercial flights from China through Los Angeles and San Francisco. That\u2019s up from the 8,400 that Newsom cited on Thursday, though officials said the number increases daily as more flights arrive. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Officials are not too worried, for now, about casual contact, because federal officials think the coronavirus is spread only through \u201cclose contact, being within six feet of somebody for what they\u2019re calling a prolonged period of time,\u201d said Dr. James Watt, interim state epidemiologist at the California Department of Public Health. The virus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia. Health officials think it spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads. As infectious disease experts fanned out in the Solano County city of Vacaville, some residents in the city between San Francisco and Sacramento stocked up on supplies amid fears things could get worse despite official reassurances, while others took the news in stride. The woman in the community who has coronavirus first sought treatment at NorthBay VacaValley Hospital in Vacaville, before her condition worsened and she was transferred to the medical center in Sacramento. Sacramento County\u2019s top health official\u00a0 \u00a0on Friday that he expects several medical workers to test positive themselves in the next few days. Numerous workers at both hospitals have been tested, but the tests were sent to labs approved by the CDC and generally take three to four days to complete. Peter Beilenson, Sacramento County\u2019s health services director, said he expects even those who test positive to become only mildly ill. Confusion over how quickly the woman was tested for coronavirus concerned McKinsey Paz, who works at a private security firm in Vacaville. The company has already stockpiled 450 face masks and is scrambling for more \u201csince they\u2019re hard to come by.\u201d The company\u2019s owner bought enough cleaning and disinfectant supplies to both scrub down the office and send home with employees. But they appeared to be at the extreme for preparations. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Eugenia Kendall was wearing a face mask, but in fear of anything including the common cold. Her immune system is impaired because she is undergoing chemotherapy, and she has long been taking such precautions. \u201cWe\u2019re not paranoid. We\u2019re just trying to be practical,\u201d said her husband of 31 years, Ivan Kendall. \u201cWe wipe the shopping carts if they have them, and when I get back in the car I wipe my hands \u2014 and just hope for the best.\u201d Experts in both communities are interviewing immediate family members and expanding their net to include more distant family members who may have been in contact, social gatherings like church that the patient may have attended and any possible time spent at work or events like a concert. Besides the woman, all the other cases in the U.S. have been for people who traveled abroad or had close contact with others who traveled. Earlier U.S. cases included 14 in people who returned from outbreak areas in China, or their spouses; three people who were evacuated from the central China city of Wuhan; and 42 American passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The number of people sickened by the virus hovered Friday around 83,000, and there were more than 2,800 deaths, most of them in China."},
{"title": "California 1st U.S. state to require COVID-19 vaccines for school staff - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted August 11, 2021 8:25 pm", "body": "California will become the first state in the nation to require all teachers and school staff to get vaccinated or undergo weekly   testing, as schools return from summer break amid growing concerns about the highly contagious delta variant, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday. The new policy applies to both public and private schools and will affect more than 800,000 employees, including about 320,000 public school teachers and a host of support staff such as cafeteria workers and cleaners, the state Department of Public Health said. It will also apply to school volunteers. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Newsom announced the new policy at a San Francisco Bay Area school that reopened earlier this week to in-person classes. Many California schools are back in session, with others starting in the coming weeks. \u201cWe think this is the right thing to do, and we think this is a sustainable way to keeping our schools open and to address the number one anxiety that parents like myself have for young children,\u201d said Newsom, who is a father of four. \u201cThat is knowing that the schools are doing everything in their power to keep our kids safe.\u201d Several large school districts in the state have issued similar requirements in recent days, including San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose and Long Beach Unified. California, like the rest of the country, has seen a troubling surge in COVID-19 infections because of the delta variant, which represents the vast majority of new cases. It has affected children more than previous strains of the virus, prompting a growing number of teachers unions to ease earlier opposition to vaccine mandates. California\u2019s two largest teachers unions, both powerful political allies to the governor, said Wednesday they fully supported Newsom\u2019s policy. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The California Teachers Association and the California Federation of Teachers both cited state and national polling that indicates nearly 90% of educators have been vaccinated but said the rising spread of the delta variant, particularly among children, makes the new policy necessary. Children under 12 are not yet eligible to be vaccinated. \u201cEducators want to be in classrooms with their students, and the best way to make sure that happens is for everyone who is medically eligible to be vaccinated, with robust testing and multi-tiered safety measures,\u201d CTA President E. Toby Boyd said in a statement. While Hawaii Gov. David Ige announced last week that all Department of Education staffers would be required to disclose their vaccination status or face weekly testing, California\u2019s order is far more sweeping, applying to all staff who work in both public and private schools in the country\u2019s most populous state. Over the past few weeks, Newsom has mandated that all health care workers must be fully vaccinated and required that all state employees get vaccinated or choose weekly testing. The weekly testing schedule is based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For schools, Newsom had already issued a mask mandate that applies to teachers and students. But until Wednesday, he had left the decision of whether to require vaccines up to local districts. Vaccine mandates are perilous for the Democratic governor, who faces a recall election next month fueled in part by anger over his handling of the pandemic. California was the first state to order a pandemic lockdown in March 2020, which shuttered businesses and schools statewide. While many private schools maintained in-person classes, most public schools kept students in distance learning for up to a year. Newsom faced intense political pressure to reopen schools from Republican opponents and supporters who urged him to override powerful labor unions. Many public schools finally reopened last spring, lagging much of the country. Newsom pushed for a full return to in-person learning this fall. But his mask mandate for schools has angered some parents and been criticized by Republican candidates vying to replace him. Several of the GOP candidates criticized the new plan Wednesday. Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, who has encouraged everyone to get vaccinated, said state officials \u201cshould not be pushing uniform statewide orders on every school district across the state\u201d but should leave it to local districts. Details of how the new policy will be enforced were not announced. Labor unions say those logistics still need to be worked out. Matthew Hardy, a spokesman for the California Federation of Teachers, said the union supports the plan that allows an option for testing. \u201cWe do not think people should lose their jobs over this,\u201d he said. Schools are required to be in full compliance with the new policy by Oct. 15, giving schools time to verify vaccination status and have in place weekly testing for unvaccinated staff, said Amelia Matier, a spokeswoman in the governor\u2019s office. Newsom did not rule out expanding the requirement to students after a vaccine is approved for children under 12 years old. \u201cWe\u2019ll consider all options in the future,\u201d he said, in response to a question. \u201cWe believe this is a meaningful first step.\u201d \u2014 Ronayne reported from Sacramento, California."},

The travellers told the Canada Border Service Agency border guards they were going to the United States to get gas. The federal government announced over the weekend an exemption for Canadians travelling to get gas and food to the current law requiring a negative molecular COVID-19 test. The exemption was put in place to help remove pressure on Metro Vancouver\u2019s gas supply after the provincial government put in a cap of 30 litres per day for non-essential vehicles. The rule change was just one policy amended to help British Columbians deal with the aftermath of last week\u2019s storm. Marlane Jones told Global News she travelled from her South Surrey home to the United States on Monday morning. She filled up her vehicle with gas and returned the Pacific crossing within 10 minutes. \u201cI came back and CBSA issued me a $5,700 fine because they said I was returning without the mandatory PCR test,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe other option was to go further south and get the PCR test and wait for the results up to 72 hours. I had no medication, no clothes with me so I got the ticket.\u201d The CBSA border guard told Jones she was the ninth person as of 8 a.m. Monday morning to have been fined. She was given a COVID-19 test at the border but it was missing a piece. Jones then went and received a PCR test in Surrey and must now isolate at home until it comes back negative. \u201cI thought I was doing a good thing. I have got to tell you, it was pretty intimidating coming into Canada as a Canadian and having the CBSA speak to you like that,\u201d Jones said. The $5,700 fine was levied on behalf of the Public Health Agency of Canada for violations of The Quarantine Act. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Senior government officials have told Global News PHAC will not be pursuing the fines issued to Jones and others. The CBSA have now been given new instructions and the rules were misapplied in this case. B.C.

{"title": "Germany to pass 100,000 deaths from COVID-19 as virus surges again - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted November 24, 2021 7:40 am", "body": " is poised to pass the mark of 100,000 deaths from   this week, a somber milestone that several of its neighbors crossed months ago but which Western Europe\u2019s most populous nation had hoped to avoid. Discipline, a robust health care system and the rollout of multiple vaccines \u2014 one of them homegrown \u2014 were meant to stave off a winter surge of the kind that hit Germany last year. In practice, Germans faced a confusing array of pandemic rules, lax enforcement and a national election \u2014 followed by a drawn-out government transition during which senior politicians dangled the prospect of further lifting restrictions even as the infection rate rose. \u201cNobody had the guts to take the lead and announce unpopular measures,\u201d said Uwe Janssens, who heads the intensive care department at the St. Antonius hospital in Eschweiler, west of Cologne. \u201cThis lack of leadership is the reason we are here now,\u201d he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Doctors like Janssens are bracing for an influx of coronavirus patients as confirmed cases hit fresh daily highs that experts say is also being fueled by vaccine skeptics. Resistance to getting the shot \u2014 including the one developed by German company BioNTech together with U.S. partner Pfizer \u2014 remains strong among a sizeable minority of the country. Vaccination rates have stalled at 68% of the population, far short of the 75% or higher that the government had aimed for. \u201cWe\u2019ve increasingly got younger people in intensive care,\u201d said Janssens. \u201cThe amount of time they\u2019re treated is significantly longer and it blocks intensive care beds for a longer period.\u201d Older people who got vaccinated early in 2021 are also seeing their immunity wear off, making them vulnerable to serious illness again, he said. Echoing\u00a0 , authorities have struggled to meet demand for boosters even as they tried to encourage holdouts to get their first shot. Some German politicians are suggesting it\u2019s time to consider a vaccine mandate, either for specific professions or for the population as a whole.\u00a0 , announcing COVID-19 shots will become compulsory for all starting in February after seeing a similar reluctance to get vaccinated fuel fresh outbreaks and hospitalizations. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Germany\u2019s outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel said in June that she didn\u2019t favor such a measure. Signaling a possible shift in position, Merkel summoned leaders from the\u00a0 \u00a0for talks Tuesday at the chancellery to discuss the pandemic situation. Merkel\u2019s likely successor, current Finance Minister Olaf Scholz of the center-left Social Democrats, has refused to be drawn on whether he would back compulsory COVID-19 shots. Together with the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats, his party recently passed a law that replaces the existing legal foundations for pandemic restrictions with narrower measures, starting Wednesday. These include a requirement for workers to provide their employers with proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative test. But the change also makes it harder for Germany\u2019s 16 governors to impose hard lockdowns without getting approval from state assemblies. Getting those majorities may be particularly tricky in states where case numbers are highest.\u00a0 \u00a0infection rates are higher in areas where the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, is strongest. The party has campaigned against pandemic restrictions and polls show its supporters take a sharply negative view of vaccine mandates, compared to the rest of the voting population. While AfD is not expected to win any of Germany\u2019s four regional elections next year, experts say political campaigns can distract from tough topics like tackling the pandemic. \u201cOften the focus is on things that will drive voting, rather than unpopular decisions,\u201d said Catherine Smallwood, a coronavirus expert at the World Health Organization\u2019s office for Europe. \u201cThat can contribute to the virus spreading if measures and decision-making are not taken in a timely and \u2026 concrete manner as they as they have to be,\u201d Smallwood said in a recent interview. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Germany\u2019s disease control agency on reported a record 66,884 newly confirmed cases Wednesday, and 335 deaths. The total death toll from COVID-19 stood at 99,768 since the start of the pandemic, the Robert Koch Institute said. German weekly Die Zeit, which conducts its own count based on local health authority figures, said the 100,000 threshold had already been passed. Meanwhile, health authorities in five eastern states and Bavaria have activated an emergency system to coordinate the distribution of 80 seriously ill patients to other parts of the country. Earlier this month, two patients were taken from southern Germany to Italy for treatment, a significant change from last year, when Italian patients were being sent to German hospitals. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Germany boasted almost four times as many intensive care beds per capita as Italy had then, a factor that experts say was\u00a0 . Since January, Germany has had to cut its ICU capacity by 4,000 beds due to lack of staff, many of whom have quit because of the pressure they endured earlier in the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to cope with this, physically and psychologically,\u201d Janssens said of the situation doctors and nurses face in the coming months. \u201cWe\u2019ll survive, somehow,\u201d he added. The World Health Organization\u2019s European office\u00a0 that availability of hospital beds will again decide how well the region copes with the expected rise in cases over the coming months \u2014 along with vaccination rates. Based on current trends, Europe could see another 700,000 deaths reported across the 53-nation region by next spring, with 49 countries expected to see \u201chigh or extreme stress in intensive care units,\u201d the agency said Tuesday."},

Given vaccine supply constraints, immunization programs should focus on protecting groups at high risk of hospitalization and death, the WHO said. \u201cAs many parts of the world face extreme vaccine shortages, countries with high coverage in at-risk populations should prioritize global sharing of COVID-19 vaccines before vaccinating children, adolescents,\u201d it said."},

In a briefing Thursday, Premier Blaine Higgs announced that beginning Friday at 6 p.m., everyone \u2014 including people who are fully vaccinated \u2014 must self-isolate for 14 days if someone from their household tests positive for COVID-19. Higgs said he is trying a new tactic after circuit breaker measures did not have the desired impact in Zone 1, the Moncton region. That area has been in a circuit breaker with heightened restrictions for the past six weeks, but case counts there continues to be high. \u201cRather than penalize everyone, we are focusing on key areas of concern,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is why we are implementing a targeted measure, province-wide, to address where we are seeing the virus spread.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Higgs said much of the COVID-19 spread continues to be within households. Under the new rules, people who are fully vaccinated can get a PCR test on their fifth day and leave self-isolation if it\u2019s negative. A negative PCR test will be required on the 10th day. \u201cWe recognize that even though you\u2019ve been vaccinated, you can still be a carrier, you can still transmit to someone else,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if someone in your household tests positive, and you\u2019re connected with that person and you\u2019ve had exposure, you need to ensure that you, too, don\u2019t become someone who\u2019s transmitting it to someone else.\u201d Those who violate the self-isolation rules can face fines\u00a0between $480 and $20,400. As well, the province is lifting circuit breaker measures in Zones 1 and 7 beginning Friday at 6 p.m. \u201cWe have to find a balance between what we think of is back to normal, and living with the COVID-19 virus,\u201d he said. The premier also noted that Friday is the deadline for public sector workers in the province to get vaccinated against COVID-19. \u201cWe want to be sure that government employees have a healthy and safe workplace,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day tomorrow, any employee who is not fully vaccinated, who has not received one dose and has confirmed an appointment for a second dose, will be sent home without pay.\u201d He said there will be \u201cvery, very few exceptions\u201d to this rule. Higgs said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of government employees are fully vaccinated or have received at least one dose and the number of unvaccinated employees are \u201cvery low.\u201d In government departments, 2.9 per cent of workers \u2014 or 307 people \u2014 are unvaccinated. That number is 4.1 per cent, or 792 people, in school districts; 3.4 per cent, or 734 people, working in regional health or Medavie; and 2.5 per cent, or 162 people, working for Crown corporations. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Higgs said there have been \u201cenormous improvements\u201d in public sector vaccination rates since the mandate was announced. \u201cInitially, nearly 10 per cent of employees throughout the government were not vaccinated, and now we are down to just over 3 per cent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still hopeful that these remaining employees will choose to get their vaccinations, but in the meantime, we must protect all of those working here at the government of New Brunswick.\u201d New Brunswick reported 72 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday.

Elsewhere in the Netherlands, two soccer matches in the top professional league had to be briefly halted after fans \u2014 banned from matches under a partial lockdown in force in the Netherlands for a week \u2014 broke into stadiums in the towns of Alkmaar and Almelo. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Earlier Saturday, two protests against COVID-19 measures went off peacefully in Amsterdam and the southern city of Breda. Police said in a tweet that seven people were arrested in The Hague and five officers were injured. One needed treatment in a hospital. Local media outlet Regio 15 reported that rioters threw bicycles, wooden pallets and motorized scooters on one of the fires. The rioting in The Hague was on a smaller scale than the pitched battles on the streets of Rotterdam on Friday night, when police said that three rioters were hit by bullets and investigations were underway to establish if they were shot by police. Earlier, police said two people were hit. The condition of the injured rioters was not disclosed. Officers in Rotterdam arrested 51 people, about half of them minors, police said Saturday afternoon. One police officer was hospitalized with a leg injury sustained in the rioting, another was treated by ambulance staff and \u201ccountless\u201d others suffered minor injuries. Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb told reporters in the early hours of Saturday morning that \u201con a number of occasions the police felt it necessary to draw their weapons to defend themselves\u201d as rioters rampaged through the port city\u2019s central shopping district, setting fires and throwing rocks and fireworks at officers. \u201cThey shot at protesters, people were injured,\u201d Aboutaleb said.

In January, rioters also attacked police and set fires on the streets of Rotterdam after a curfew came into force. Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus condemned the events. \u201cThe riots and extreme violence against police officers, riot police and firefighters last night in Rotterdam are disgusting to see,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cProtesting is a great right in our society, but what we saw last night is simply criminal behavior. It has nothing to do with demonstrating,\u201d he added. Police units from around the country raced to Rotterdam to help bring Friday night\u2019s situation under control. Aboutaleb said that gangs of soccer hooligans were involved in the rioting. Video from social media shown on Dutch broadcaster NOS appeared to show one person being shot in Rotterdam, but there was no immediate word on what happened. Police said in a tweet that it was \u201cstill unclear how and by whom\u201d that person was apparently shot. An independent investigation into the shootings by police was opened, as is the case whenever Dutch police use their weapons. The government has said it wants to introduce a law that would allow businesses to restrict the country\u2019s coronavirus pass system to only people who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 \u2014 that would exclude people who test negative.

{"title": "Quebec ombudswoman calls for review of long-term care model after COVID-19 deaths\u00a0  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted November 23, 2021 3:16 pm", "body": "Long-term care homes were almost totally forgotten in Quebec\u2019s early COVID-19 planning, the province\u2019s ombudswoman said Tuesday in a report that called for widespread changes to \u201chumanize\u201d the senior care model in the province. Marie Rinfret\u2019s report tabled Tuesday said government officials took a \u201chospital-centric\u201d approach to preparing for the pandemic based on images of overwhelmed hospitals in Italy and elsewhere in Europe. The strategy neglected the danger posed to the vulnerable residents of long-term care homes, known in Quebec as CHSLDs, the report concluded. \u201cWhile Quebec\u2019s eyes were turned toward Italy, no risk analysis tailored to Quebec\u2019s residential-resource model and its specific features was carried out in crafting the strategy in response to the pandemic,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is how CHSLDs slipped through the cracks of any scenario.\u201d This failure to prepare had devastating consequences on the care homes\u2019 ability to handle the first wave, the report found. In order to free up beds, patients were transferred from hospitals to care homes that had neither the staff, equipment nor the infection-control expertise to manage the health crisis that would engulf them. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Rinfret\u2019s report contradicts testimony given by former health minister Danielle McCann, who told a coroner\u2019s inquest last week that the heads of the regional health authorities had been told in January to update their contingency plans for long-term care homes. In a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Rinfret said that while officials had expressed concern about the impact of COVID-19 on care homes, no \u201cconcrete and specific\u201d action was taken before mid-March. \u201cSo yes, there was a worry, but this worry didn\u2019t translate in reality into knowing what was the situation in the CHSLDs, what was the risk associated with transferring people from alternative levels of care in hospitals to these living environments,\u201d she said. The transfers created overcapacity in residences that were already short-staffed, she said, adding that officials also failed to account for the staff absences the virus would cause. Rinfret told reporters she did not believe the problem stemmed from negligence, but rather from a fundamental misperception of long-term care homes as mere living environments, rather than places that need to provide complex care approaching that of hospitals. Almost 4,000 people died in the homes between February and June 2020, accounting for nearly 70 per cent of the deaths reported in Quebec during the first wave. An interim report published in December 2020 found the government failed in its duty to ensure the safety and dignity of residents, some of whom died alone and without palliative care. The report published Tuesday called for a vast review of the way long-term care is delivered in the province in order to \u201chumanize\u201d conditions for residents and staff alike. \u201cFor the women and men who attend to elderly people\u2019s health and well-being to be better recognized and valued, CHSLD working environments must be held in greater esteem,\u201d the report read. \u201cCaregivers were heroes at the height of an unprecedented crisis. For them, and for the residents and their families, the status quo is unthinkable.\u201d The report paints a picture of a health system that was thrown into chaos, resulting in improvised decisions, confusion around staffing and a failure to properly apply directives. The government\u2019s information systems were outdated, which made it hard to organize staff and transmit information in real time, it found. Understaffed homes struggled to separate infected and non-infected residents, and many workers were not properly trained in infection control and use of personal protective equipment. And, unlike British Columbia, the Quebec government was unable to stop the movement of workers between facilities, despite this being acknowledged early as a risk factor for COVID-19 spread. Instead, Quebec focused on the risk posed by visits from caregivers, who were banned from the facilities to the detriment of residents\u2019 quality of life. Quebec Premier Francois Legault said Tuesday that the government was lacking information in the pandemic\u2019s early days. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to make decisions when you don\u2019t have all the information, and the information I had at the time was that we would have problems in our ERs, in our hospitals, not in our long-term care facilities,\u201d he told reporters in Quebec City. \u201cAt the beginning, we didn\u2019t know that we would (be missing) 10,000 employees in our long-term care facilities.\u201d Rinfret\u2019s 27 recommendations touch on strengthening nearly every aspect of the long-term care system. They include adopting a risk assessment and management policy in long-term care homes and creating a detailed plan for infection prevention and control. Other recommendations include a strategy to improve communication between departments, a plan to deploy emergency workers when needed, and a strategy to combat labour shortages. Finally, Rinfret recommended the government organize annual acts of commemoration, which will serve as a reminder of the losses sustained and \u201chighlight the generous contribution of those who struggled to keep care and services afloat during this period of turmoil.\u201d"},

Medical Officer of Health Dr. Elizabeth Richardson told   it\u2019s expected the city will get close to all the doses needed from the initial shipment to vaccinate Hamilton\u2019s eligible population 5 to 11. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe will certainly get enough to get all of them done with our clinics opening actually on Thursday,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cYou can start booking \u2026 your vaccine appointments tomorrow and then start \u2026 getting shots as early as Thursday.\u201d Settings for the shots will be through a number of different clinics, including fixed sites at Lime Ridge Mall, the Braley Health Centre and the Centre on Barton, child-friendly mobile clinics, pharmacies as well as youth friendly clinics. \u201cKids at times can be scared of needles or may have some other apprehension,\u201d said Richardson. \u201cSo our partners at McMaster Children\u2019s Hospital and their child life specialists are helping to provide some clinics that are particularly friendly for children who are having those kinds of anxieties as well.\u201d School-based clinics are not a part of the initial rollout for those 5 to 11 due to the complexity of such a campaign requiring parents and guardians to be present of the shots. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to accomplish during the school day when they\u2019re still trying to carry on with education for our kids at the same time,\u201d Richardson revealed. \u201cSo likely what will happen over time is we\u2019ll continue to look at how the schools fit into the plan.\u201d  recommends a two-dose regiment administered eight weeks apart for the Pfizer shot which has shown a 90.7 percent effectiveness rate in children 5 to 11 \u2013 similar to the effectiveness of the adult dosage.

An estimated 20,000 doses are expected in Niagara in the first week from the initial Canadian shipment. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The region has an estimated 32,500 aged 5 to 11 eligible for shots. Acting medical officer of health Mustafa Hirji says the shots not only work but are showing in   studies that they have fewer side effect such as fatigue, headaches and muscle pain exhibited in adult shots. The data comes from a multinational, placebo-controlled efficacy trial which showed children aged under 12 had significantly lower after effects compared to counterparts aged 16 to 25. \u201cChildren are going to actually have an even better experience with a vaccine, get an even safer vaccine, but still get all of that protection,\u201d Hirji said.

It\u2019s expected the booster shots will be made available in January to anyone in the eligible 12-plus population who wants it.

This includes masking and keeping small social circles alongside getting fully vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe\u2019ve done really well here in the southeast part of Ontario, particularly in KFL&A, during waves one, two and three,\u201d Dr. Gerald Evans said. \u201cAs a result of that and these very high vaccination rates, I think there\u2019s a general kind of view that maybe we\u2019re over the hump of COVID.\u201d Dr. Evans is the chair of the division of infectious diseases at Queen\u2019s University and KHSC. He says that even though we have high immunization rates in the region, the rise in case count can be partially attributed to people feeling more comfortable and becoming less strict with safety measures. According to Evans, for every 10 people added to your social circle, there is a roughly 25 per cent increase in risk of COVID-19 exposure. \u201cIf we weren\u2019t this heavily vaccinated in KFL&A, the number of cases we would be seeing would be actually substantially higher than what we\u2019re seeing at the moment,\u201d he says. While Evans says there\u2019s no question that vaccination is the number one strategy to fight COVID-19, cases will still occur within the vaccinated population. \u201cNow that most people are vaccinated, yes, you\u2019re going to see cases popping up in vaccinated people,\u201d Evans said. \u201cWhat we do know about most of those vaccinated people is it\u2019s very uncommon for them to have a serious course.\u201d The burden of cases across Ontario remains to be in unvaccinated individuals. \u201cThe risk of getting COVID if you\u2019re unvaccinated compared to a vaccinated person is very high,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere around seven to eight times higher.\u201d Around 22 per cent of Ontarians are not yet vaccinated, but about half of those people are already eligible. \u201cEverybody needs to continue to do all the good things that we were doing before the vaccination came along,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not vaccinated, get vaccinated. Absolutely, it is going to help our local community out well.\u201d Evans says one-third of unvaccinated Ontarians make up children in the five to 11 age group, who are not yet eligible. That group is expected to help nudge the numbers, but Ontario will still have a substantial amount of unvaccinated people. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThe holidays are about six weeks away and we need to do everything now to drive down those numbers,\u201d Evans said. \u201cKeep the numbers low, so that we can actually have a safe and enjoyable holiday season with our friends and family over that period of time where last year, we were really, really, severely hampered because vaccines had just become available.\u201d Dr. Evans says 90 to 95 per cent of Ontarians would need to be vaccinated to see considerable effects, including the possibility of herd immunity."},

Dutch\u00a0authorities used water canon, dogs and mounted police to stop rioting youths who set fires and threw fireworks in the worst disturbances since a full lockdown led to widespread disorder and more than 500 arrests in January. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The latest unrest began on Friday night in Rotterdam, where police opened fire on a crowd that had swelled to hundreds during a protest the city\u2019s mayor said had turned into \u201can orgy of violence.\u201d Three people believed to be hit by police bullets remained in hospital on Sunday, a statement by the authorities said. The protests were sparked by opposition to government plans to restrict use of a national corona pass to people who have either recovered from COVID-19 or have been vaccinated, excluding those with a negative test result. The Netherlands reimposed some lockdown measures on its 17.5 million population last weekend for an initial three weeks in an effort to slow a resurgence of the virus, but daily infections have remained at their highest levels since the start of the pandemic. Youths were also angered by a New Year\u2019s Eve firework ban to avoid added pressure on hospitals that have already been forced to scale back care due to a surge in COVID-19 patients. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Some of the most serious confrontations on Saturday night were in The Hague, where five officers were hurt, one of them seriously, a police statement said.

Two Eredivisie league soccer matches, which have been closed to the public under the tougher COVID-19 restrictions, were briefly disrupted on Saturday night as small groups of fans forced their way into the stadiums and threw fireworks. Another 13 arrests were reported by police in two towns in the southern province of Limburg, while disturbances were also reported in the northern province of Flevoland. Eight people were detained in the town of Urk, where a COVID-19 testing station was torched earlier this year.

She noted that with contagious strains like the Delta variant, the province has seen an increase in children with COVID-19. She said 30 per cent of all cases since the beginning of September have involved youth under the age of 20. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Shephard said there are no plans yet to make vaccines mandatory for children to do things like extracurricular activities or eat at restaurants. \u201cWe really don\u2019t want parents under any more duress, we want them to be able to get their education into the vaccines as freely as they will,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we\u2019ve done with all of the other processes, we are opening it up and we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d Dr. Jennifer Russell, the province\u2019s chief medical officer of health, added that while the concept of mRNA vaccines may be unfamiliar to many people, the technology behind mRNA vaccines is not new. \u201cResearchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades to explore treatments for everything from the flu, to Zika virus, to rabies,\u201d she said. \u201cI do want to reassure parents that the development of these vaccines was not rushed. Because of the urgency of the pandemic, vaccine developers worked with scientists around the world to gather scientific data at the same time, and this unprecedented level of global co-operation allowed mRNA vaccines to complete all clinical trial stages.\u201d Russell said 87.5 per cent of New Brunswickers aged 12 and up are fully vaccinated and 93.4 per cent have had their first dose. Beginning Monday, the province will begin including children aged five to 11 \u2014 about 54,500 people \u2014 in their statistics, and Russell said this may cause the rate of vaccination to go down, but she expects it to rise again as more children get vaccinated. She said children will need two doses for full protection, with each dose at least eight weeks apart. Dr. Rachel Ouellette, a Fredericton-based pediatrician, said the vaccines for children are a third of the size of those for people aged 12 and older and have been \u201cthoroughly tested\u201d and are safe for children. She said it\u2019s common to experience side effects from the vaccine, like a sore arm or flu-like symptoms. Those with symptoms lasting longer than 72 hours should see their health-care provider, she said, adding that more serious symptoms are \u201cextremely rare.\u201d Ouellette also said some children might be scared to get the shot. \u201cWhile many parents have been eagerly waiting to have their children vaccinated, we all know it isn\u2019t always easy to convince the kids to get a needle. My kids call them pick-picks,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my practice I often encounter children who are scared of needles, and I know how difficult it can be as a parent to see your child experiencing fear or distress.\u201d She recommended that children bring their favourite toy to their appointment, as well as a distraction like a book or a phone. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to give them screen time for this scenario,\u201d she said. Children can also be given a sense of control by getting to choose which arm gets the shot. Ouellette also said some parents may be hesitant to get their children vaccinated because they might feel that they are less at risk of contracting or getting seriously ill from the virus. \u201cWhile some cases of COVID-19 in kids are mild and asymptomatic, it is also true that some kids have become very sick. They can end up hospitalized, or even die,\u201d she said. \u201cLong-term COVID-19 complications, or symptoms like fatigue, shortness of breath or difficulty concentrating, can last for months after the infection.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Ouellette added that children have missed out on a lot during the pandemic: they\u2019ve missed school, extracurricular activities, social events and have been unable to see family members. She said New Brunswickers can help regain control over the fourth wave of the pandemic by ensuring their whole family is vaccinated. \u201cWe know that over the last 20 months, our kids have had to miss out on so much, yet they\u2019re so resilient,\u201d she said. \u201cBy choosing to vaccinate your child, you can ensure they are able to continue with their daily routines and will not have to worry about missing out on important events and activities.\u201d"},

The health unit\u2019s booking portal will begin taking appointments starting at 8 a.m., MLHU officials said in a media release on Monday \u2014 issued a short time after the Ontario government announced a similar move with the provincial booking system. The vaccine will require two doses of 10 micrograms each for kids aged five to 11 \u2014 one-third of the dose for adults. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization is recommending the two doses be spaced eight weeks apart.

The paediactric vaccine is expected to be available in participating pharmacies and primary care offices by early next week. In a statement prior to the briefing, health officials said they had been planning the move for weeks, making the Western Fair Agriplex and Mount Brydges vaccination sites more welcoming for children. In addition, officials were preparing resources to provide to parents who may have questions. Children attending the mass vaccination sites will be greeted with bright-coloured banners, stickers on the floor promoting social distancing, and \u201cstress stars\u201d that they can squeeze, along with activities and family pods where they will receive the COVID-19 shot, the health unit said. Summers noted the paediactric formulation\u2019s effectiveness, with studies showing an estimated 91 per cent reduction in the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 in children five to 11. In addition, he said, the vaccine decreases the risk of complications from COVID-19, including long-term effects of COVID and hospitalization. \u201cThe vaccine will help protect loved ones around kids, protecting those who can get very sick if infected, and those for whom the vaccine may not be as effective because their immune system doesn\u2019t quite respond as well,\u201d Summers said during the briefing. \u201cThe vaccine has shown itself through its administration and adults to be remarkably safe, and the trials that were done in those five to 11 show the same. Severe adverse events are exceptionally, exceptionally rare.\u201d As of Nov. 14, of the more than 22,700,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in Ontario, just over 15,200 saw adverse events following immunization (AEFI) reported, according to the latest weekly  .

Yiu said for the past six weeks, she has been worrying about an unprecedented level of pressure on Alberta\u2019s health-care system. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t On Tuesday, she said she is feeling \u201ca little more optimistic\u201d than she has in quite some time. \u201cWe are seeing the pressure on our hospitals ease ever so slightly,\u201d she said, crediting those who have been vaccinated and following health restrictions. \u201cIt\u2019s a faint silver lining to what has been a very difficult period for our health-care system.\u201d Yiu said the situation remains extremely serious and emphasized that it\u2019s too early to note a trend. Dr. Stephanie Smith, an infectious disease expert, said a number of different metrics could point to the peak of the fourth wave. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThe first one is a decline in community numbers. That\u2019s usually the first thing we see going down. \u201cTwo to three weeks later, we see a decline in hospitalizations. That signals to us that we are on the downslope of the fourth wave,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI do think there is some reason for cautious optimism at this point in time.\u201d Smith said the best insurance for preventing further waves is widespread vaccination. She noted that the vaccine being approved and available for kids under 12 will be an extremely helpful step in preventing transmission. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cIt\u2019s proven quite difficult to predict the future of COVID-19, but if we have more and more people vaccinated, then we may continue to see some transmission in the community, but we are looking that we don\u2019t have these incredible waves of people coming to hospital and being critically ill,\u201d she said. The infectious disease expert said she and other specialists don\u2019t have a specific number for the necessary vaccine coverage but said it needs to be much higher than Alberta\u2019s current rate of 76.2 per cent of eligible people who are fully vaccinated. \u201cThe hope is with decreased transmission and increased vaccination, we won\u2019t see the emergence of other variants,\u201d Smith said. \u201cMy hope is we get to a point without significant transmission. Somewhere around 85 or 90 per cent.\u201d Global News asked Alberta Health if there is a new vaccine coverage target the province is aiming for when it comes to the easing of public health measures. In a statement, a spokesperson said: \u201cWe have not defined specific thresholds for easing public health measures or eliminating the restrictions exemption program. The REP is expected to remain in place through at least the first quarter of 2022.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation in Alberta closely,\u201d Alberta Health said. \u201cAny future move to ease public health measures will consider many factors, including the spread of COVID-19, pressure on the health system, vaccination rates, the need to balance restrictions with their impacts on overall health, global evidence and the advice of experts like Dr. Deena Hinshaw.\u201d Smith said she would continue to recommend other layers of protection until we are in a more endemic stage of COVID-19, including mask-wearing and physical distancing."},

Experts explain - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted September 19, 2021 7:00 am", "body": "Months after emergency use approval, both the Pfizer and Moderna   vaccines were given their full stamp by Health Canada \u2014 a stamp that came with new names for the vaccines, as well. In a tweet Thursday morning, Canada\u2019s health agency announced the new names, with Pfizer\u2019s vaccine now being known as \u201cComirnaty,\u201d Moderna\u2019s jab as \u201cSpikevax\u201d and AstraZeneca\u2019s shot would be called \u201cVaxzevria.\u201d (3/4) These are only name changes. There are no changes to the vaccines themselves. \u2014 Health Canada and PHAC (@GovCanHealth)  \u201cThese are only name changes. There are no changes to the vaccines themselves,\u201d Health Canada said. While the full approval means that kids aged 12 and up are now able to receive their shots of Comirnaty or Spikevax, the renaming raised some concern over possible confusion people might have with the new \u201ccomplicated\u201d names \u2014 especially during a time when Canada is struggling to increase its vaccine uptake. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Health and vaccine experts tell Global News that the renaming really is just a part of the normal regulatory process that the vaccines have to undergo and that their old names would most likely stick in the long run. Scott Halperin, director of the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology and professor at Dalhousie University, explained that the renaming was not Health Canada\u2019s choice, but rather a branding exercise decided by the vaccine makers themselves. \u201cSo it\u2019s the companies that did it, and the condition is that companies are not allowed to market the vaccine or a drug before it\u2019s approved for use,\u201d said Halperin. \u201cNow what happened with COVID vaccines is unusual in that they did not receive full approval, they were released for emergency use authorization.\u201d Halperin pointed to the lack of marketing around COVID-19 vaccines in Canada the last year-and-a-half due to the approval process and that vaccine makers weren\u2019t allowed to name their drugs in Canada without full approval. \u201cSo it\u2019s not that they renamed them. It\u2019s just now their name is allowed to be used publicly,\u201d he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Health Canada\u2019s full approval stamp comes just weeks after the United States Food and Drug Administration fully passed the Pfizer jab on Aug. 23. \u201cBased on the longer-term follow-up data that we submitted, today\u2019s decision by Health Canada affirms the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine at a time when it is urgently needed,\u201d announced Fabien Paquette, the vaccines lead for Pfizer Canada, on Thursday. \u201cWhile a significant number of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated, there is still much work to be done as infection and hospitalization rates continue to rise across the country, primarily among unvaccinated populations.\u201d On whether there was concern that the new brand names would change the public\u2019s perception of the shots and influence people\u2019s decision on whether to get a dose, Halperin says his guess is that it won\u2019t make much of a difference. It\u2019s an assumption also shared by infectious diseases specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch, who said that he\u2019s still going to call them by their old names. Yeah, nobody cares.  I'm still going with Pfizer, Moderna, & AZ rather than [unpronounceable], the name of a D-division volleyball team, and Vaxixkckerkrzvia. \u2014 Isaac Bogoch (@BogochIsaac)  In an interview with Global News on Saturday, Bogoch said that he doesn\u2019t think people are going to use those brand names. \u201cThey\u2019re hard to say, they\u2019re new, they\u2019re a bit confusing and I just think people are going to continue with what they already know,\u201d he said. \u201cSince it\u2019s been announced by Health Canada, has anyone used any of these names? I heard them once \u2014 and I talk about vaccines all the time.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Bogoch said that the one change that made sense to him and was helpful was the World Health Organization (WHO) naming its variants of concern. In May, the WHO announced it had assigned several key variants of the virus letters of the Greek alphabet, such as the B.1.1.7 variant being renamed to the Alpha variant and B.1.617.2 to Delta. As for the new vaccine brand names, Bogoch was confident that it would do little to deter people from getting their vaccines or change the way they would be discussed. \u201cWith the brand names for the vaccines, I could be wrong, but I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to be using this in our day-to-day conversations \u2014 both in the field of medicine and also in regular conversation outside of medicine.\u201d \u2014\u00a0"},

Not one person 12 to 17 who has received at least one COVID-19 dose has gone to the hospital with COVID.

Thankfully, vaccine side effects, or the lack thereof, aren\u2019t much of an indicator of how well a vaccine protects you against COVID-19, experts say. \u201cWe\u2019re all a little different and all our immune responses are a little different,\u201d said Dr. Joanne Langley, a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at Dalhousie University. \u201cAnd we all have different sensitivities to the response.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Normal side effects that you might experience after getting vaccinated include pain and soreness or redness around the injection site, aches and pains, fatigue and lethargy, she said. Headaches, chills, fever and even nausea and vomiting are also relatively common side effects, especially after a second mRNA vaccine dose, according to a  . But what if you got none of these? That\u2019s what had Amanda Ferguson worried. Ferguson, who works for Toronto\u2019s Sinai Health Foundation, participated in a research study, measuring antibody levels after her vaccine. \u201cSymptom-wise, I didn\u2019t really have much of anything at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI was really, really hoping for symptoms. I know most people aren\u2019t, but because I have a compromised immune system, I wanted that sign that my body and my immune system was working. And other than a little bit of fatigue, I didn\u2019t really feel much.\u201d Because she has Crohn\u2019s disease and was taking an immunosuppressant drug, she was concerned that vaccines wouldn\u2019t be effective for her, she said. And when she read a U.K. study showing that Crohn\u2019s patients like her who took the drug Remicade didn\u2019t produce many antibodies after their first dose of vaccine, she was upset. \u201cI was sobbing, I was absolutely sobbing because I thought this thing that had become a beacon of hope that was getting me through 15 or 16 months of isolation was all of a sudden taken off the table,\u201d she said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Even after the second part of the study came out, showing that two doses were effective, she still wondered, she said. But her antibody test results put her at ease \u2013 even though she didn\u2019t have much of a reaction to the shot. \u201cI wanted that sign that my immune system is working and it was nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cSo then I had to wait another month, submit more blood tests, and then the results came back loud and clear that not only I had a good amount after the first shot, but then I had a really good number after the second.\u201d It\u2019s true that inflammation, which can cause these annoying symptoms, is necessary to build up your immunity, said Earl Brown, a professor emeritus of virology at the University of Ottawa. But, it doesn\u2019t take very much. \u201cYou need that inflammation. You need a certain amount of it. You don\u2019t need enough to make you sick,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so you\u2019re not necessarily more immune if\u00a0 you\u2019re put in bed for a day with your reaction versus those people who are out walking around with a with a sore arm.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Producing antibodies is one way that the body builds immunity to a virus, he said. And because they\u2019re relatively easy to measure through tests, it\u2019s one of the ways that vaccine effectiveness has been assessed. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that you don\u2019t have to feel a strong reaction from the vaccine to be immunized,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut in practical terms, the vaccine has to stimulate inflammation that your body responds to. So you don\u2019t have to feel unwell, but you have to have an activated immune system from your vaccine.\u201d If you do experience side effects following your COVID-19 shot, you can address the symptoms by taking medication for muscle pain, or resting if you feel tired, Langley suggested. There are some possible very rare adverse reactions for which you should seek medical attention, she said. Things like changes in your level of consciousness, chest pain or extremely high fever should be looked into, she said. The Ontario government also recommends   if you develop hives, swelling of the face or mouth, trouble breathing or numbness within three days of getting vaccinated.

Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister   said on Thursday that as of Oct. 23, new measures will be put in place to replace the broad\u00a0 \u00a0(CEWS) and the\u00a0 \u00a0(CERS), which expire on Saturday. The government said it has paid out more than $95 billion to date to help employers re-hire workers and avoid layoffs through the wage subsidy. The rent subsidy and Lockdown Support have helped more than 210,600 organizations with more than $6.8 billion in support for rent, mortgage, and other expense, the government said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The new Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program and Hardest Hit Business Recovery Program will take effect Sunday, Freeland said during a news conference. \u201cToday, our support needs to be more narrow, more targeted and less expensive and we need to look forward to the day, now not too far off, when we will be able to bring it to an end entirely,\u201d she said. The Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program will provide help through a wage and rent subsidy programs for hotels, tour operators, travel agencies and restaurants with a subsidy rate of up to 75 per cent, the government said in a news release. The Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program will provide support through the wage and rent subsidy programs for other businesses that have faced deep losses, with a subsidy rate of up to 50 per cent. For those two programs, eligibility will be a two-key system, Freeland said. First, the government will consider whether an employer has faced significant revenue loss over the course of 12 months during the pandemic. The second key is revenue loss in the current month of application. In documents provided after the news conference, the government said these current programs will run until Nov. 20, and it will propose legislation to extend these programs until May 7, 2022. It will also seek authority to make further amendments to the programs through July 2. The government also announced a lockdown support initiative to help businesses that are subject to further shutdowns across the country. For those businesses that face lockdowns, the federal government will make the wage and rent subsidy available up to the maximum amount for the duration of the closure. The proposed subsidy rates for these programs will be available through to March 13, and will then decrease by half until expiry on May 7. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Furthermore, the government plans to introduce regulations to create the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit to provide $300 a week to workers who are subject to a lockdown, including those ineligible for employment insurance. The program will be available until May 7, with retroactive applications starting Sunday. Freeland also said the government is extending the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit and Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit until May 7 and will increase the maximum duration of each benefit by two additional weeks. Finally, the government is extending the Canada Recovery Hiring Program until Nov. 20 and will increase the subsidy rate to 50 per cent. The government also plans to extend the program to May 7 through legislation. It will also seek authority to make further amendments to the programs through July 2. \u201cOur unrelenting objective is to protect and create jobs and to drive economic growth,\u201d Freeland said. \u201cIt is to ensure the strongest possible recovery for everyone.\u201d According to David Macdonald, a senior economist for the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, as many as 1.5 million workers are set to be directly affected once those programs end \u2014 most of whom won\u2019t have another source of income or support. Of those one and a half million workers, about 900,000 would be set to lose support from the CRB being cut according to Macdonald. He said that the newly announced programs \u201cdon\u2019t look like they will cover them anytime soon.\u201d As for the CERS and CEWS cuts, Macdonald estimates more than 640,000 workers\u2019 jobs could be in jeopardy, though they would still be eligible for EI despite its lack of a $500-a-week floor."},

Starting in August, days and hours of operations will be adjusted at the large-scale vaccine clinics in order to shift focus on more precise methods of getting shots into arms, says Johanu Botha, operations, logistics and planning lead from Manitoba\u2019s vaccine implementation task force. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cOur supersites are still an important part of the rollout, for now, but as the vaccine campaign evolves, the demand on our supersites and clinics are changing,\u201d he explained at a Wednesday press conference. \u201cWe are continuing our shift from the focus on volume towards access and accessibility.\u201d After months of higher demand for vaccines \u2014 that at times saw tens of thousands of doses administered at single super sites a day \u2014 Botha said the province started to see a plateau in interest start roughly three weeks ago. Many of the super sites have increasingly been taking walk-ins without a prior appointment in recent weeks.

{"title": "COVID-19 vaccine: What employers can \u2014 and cannot \u2014 demand in Canada - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted May 20, 2021 6:00 am", "body": "When it comes to the  , some U.S.   are taking a hard line. Some say employees who don\u2019t get the jab will be shown the door. Others are listing vaccination as a mandatory requirement for new hires. In Texas, the Houston Methodist Hospital network has made COVID-19 vaccines  . And Delta Air Lines recently said it will require all new hires in the United States to be vaccinated against COVID-19. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t But what\u2019s happening south of the border isn\u2019t an indication of what employers are allowed to do in Canada, labour law experts say. Here\u2019s what two employment lawyers had to say about whether employers can make vaccines compulsory or demand to know whether employees have taken the shot. While employers can make vaccines necessary in their policies, whether those requirements would hold up if challenged is another matter, says Hermie Abraham, an employment lawyer and the owner of Advocation Professional Corporation. Because the federal and provincial governments have so far refrained from making the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory, it\u2019s \u201cunlikely\u201d that workplace policies that do so will stand if tested in court or through arbitration, Abraham says. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Requiring a medical procedure such as a vaccine could be considered a breach of privacy or a human rights violation, says Lior Samfiru, partner at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP. A legal kerfuffle between Toronto\u2019s St. Michael\u2019s Hospital and the Ontario Nurses\u2019 Association (ONA) is a recent legal precedent for whether employers can mandate vaccinations, both Abraham and Samfiru say. In 2018, an arbitrator struck down a policy by St. Michael\u2019s to force nurses who had not received the flu vaccine to wear surgical masks following a grievance filed by the ONA. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Arbitrator William Kaplan called the policy \u201cunsustainable\u201d and \u201cillogical\u201d given poor evidence that surgical masks prevent transmission of the flu and that the hospital did not require unvaccinated visitors to mask up, among other reasons. Still, both Abraham and Samfiru say there are scenarios in which employer policies requesting vaccination against COVID-19 would stand on firmer legal ground. Abraham cited the example of a salesperson who must routinely travel outside Canada. If vaccine passports were to become mandatory for international travel, an unvaccinated employee might become unable to do their job, she notes. In the U.S., Delta has noted that employees who are not vaccinated may not be able to work on international flights given possible entry requirements by other countries. In Canada, if an employee\u2019s choice not to be vaccinated prevented the person from being able to perform core duties of the job, an employer would have to perform a two-step analysis, Abraham says. In a situation where the choice was motivated by religious or health reasons, the employer would have to a so-called \u201cduty to accommodate to the point of undue hardship,\u201d she says. This might involve allowing the employee to interact with international clients via teleconference, modifying the role so that only domestic travel is required or moving the worker to another role suited to their skills and experience, if possible. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t However, if there is no workable solution, or if the employee has no religious or health grounds for declining to be vaccinated, \u201cthere would be what we call \u2018a frustration of contract\u2019,\u201d Abraham says. In such a scenario, employers would likely be able to end the employment contract with limited liability, she adds. And, of course, if the government issued new rules mandating vaccinations in certain workplace settings or for specific roles, employers would be justified in implementing policies that comply with those requirements, Abraham and Samfiru say. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Quebec\u2019s Ministry of Health, for example, issued a decree in April establishing that some salaried healthcare workers will have to show proof that they have received the COVID-19 vaccine. Those who decline to do so may be assigned to different job duties or put on leave without pay. In unionized workplaces, employers and unions may also come to agreements that demand proof of vaccination for new hires, Abraham says. However, she adds, \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening as much in a non-unionized workplace.\u201d If requiring that employees get the COVID-19 shot is complicated, so is asking whether they are vaccinated or not. If Canadian health authorities were to issue guidelines saying only full-vaccinated people are allowed to mingle indoors without a mask, then it would be appropriate for employers to ask who received the shot to decide what workplace measures to put in place, Samfiru says. In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently issued guidance indicating that fully vaccinated people can resume activities in any setting without wearing a mask or physically distancing. There are no such guidelines at the moment for Canada, where the share of those who have received the full dose of the vaccine is still below four per cent of the population. But employers asking for proof of vaccination is a \u201cslippery slope,\u201d Abraham says. The requirement might result in employees feeling the pressure to have to share personal health information that goes beyond the vaccine, she adds. \u201cFor example, I might be in the early stages of pregnancy and don\u2019t want to get the COVID vaccine, but I don\u2019t want to disclose it to my employer,\u201d she says. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Employers should also think about who they\u2019d be trying to protect with policies that either mandate vaccination or ask employees to share whether they were vaccinated or not, she adds. The vaccine has primarily been made to protect those who are vaccinated, she notes. And there are already well-tested protocols employers can use to limit the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace, such as implementing mandatory testing or demand that those who exhibit COVID-19 symptoms self-isolate, she adds. Still, Abraham warns of how the issue of vaccination might play out once more Canadians are allowed to return to the office. \u201cThe whole COVID vaccine and stay-at-home orders \u2014 they\u2019ve been very polarizing,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a potential for conflict in the workplace as it pertains to employees taking the law into their own hands.\u201d On both sides of the vaccine divide, the concern is workplace harassment and bullying, she says. Samfiru, for his part, sees trouble brewing for employers who are taking a heavy-handed approach to vaccination. I\u2019ve received a number of calls over the past couple of months from individuals who have been given these ultimatums from their employer: get vaccinated or else,\u201d he says. \u201cI think these employers will find themselves on the wrong side of a wrongful dismissal claim.\u201d"},

In a tweet Friday night, Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Bill Blair stated the armed forces are on their way to the province to provide the necessary support to fight the pandemic. Blair added discussions are also underway for additional Canadian Red Cross personnel to deploy to the province, which is suffering the worst weekly death rate in the country.

So far, six intensive care unit patients have been transferred to Ontario hospitals and three more are scheduled to transfer between Friday and Sunday. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency president Marlo Pritchard said in a Friday briefing added these transfers are being made to reduce strain on the province\u2019s health-care system. As of Friday, there are 80 COVID-19 ICU patients in Saskatchewan hospitals. Pritchard said the provincial emergency operations centre continues to hold meetings with the federal government, including Public Safety Canada. He said good progress has been made so far. \u201cI expect to have more information soon about having boots on the ground at some point next week,\u201d Pritchard told reporters. The Saskatchewan Health Authority said Friday it may soon activate the next stage of its triage plan due to the stress on the health-care system. Derek Miller, the authority\u2019s chief of emergency operations, said a committee made up of doctors and ethicists is set to prepare a formal recommendation to move to the second stage of triage. The province has been operating under the first stage for several months, which has involved cancelling surgeries to free up bed space and health-care workers to focus on\u00a0COVID\u00a0cases. The second stage involves doctors consulting with ethicists about who and who does not get life-saving care. Data from the health authority for this month shows\u00a0Saskatchewan\u00a0had the most residents in intensive care units per capita than any other province at any point in the pandemic. Earlier this week, the province released modelling that shows hospitalizations are likely to increase until December, unless restrictions are reintroduced, and health care might not return to sustainable levels until March."},

Horizon Health also said Monday that the temporary closure of the labour and birth unit at the Upper River Valley Hospital in Waterville, N.B. will remain in place until Nov. 2 \u201cat the earliest.\u201d The health network says the closure is necessary because of staffing adjustments to provide care for COVID-19 patients at the hospital.

They said a trial of 10,000 participants aged 16 or older showed 95.6 per cent effectiveness against the diseases, during a period when the Delta strain was prevalent. The study also found that the booster shot had a favorable safety profile. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Pfizer had said its two-shot vaccine\u2019s efficacy drops over time, citing a study that showed 84 per cent effectiveness from a peak of 96 per cent four months after a second dose. Some countries had already gone ahead with plans to give booster doses. The drugmakers said the median time between the second dose and the booster shot or the placebo in the study was around 11 months, adding that there were only five cases of COVID-19 in the booster group, compared with 109 cases in the group which received the placebo shot. \u201cThese results provide further evidence of the benefits of boosters as we aim to keep people well-protected against this disease,\u201d Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. The median age of the participants was 53 years, with 55.5 per cent of participants between 16 and 55 years, and 23.3 per cent at 65 years or older. The companies said they would submit detailed results of the trial for peer-reviewed publication, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency, and other regulatory agencies as soon as possible. U.S., E.U. and Canadian regulators have recommended a third dose of COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Inc for patients with compromised immune systems who are likely to have weaker protection from the two-dose regimens. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Canada is also recommending a third dose for residents of long-term care homes and seniors living in other congregate settings."},

The variant was also more likely to break through protections afforded by the vaccines, but the health authority said such incidents were very rare, the CDC report posted on the Washington Post website showed. In its summary, the CDC report said Delta is highly contagious, likely more severe than other variants and breakthrough infections may be as transmissible as unvaccinated cases. Still, the CDC\u2019s figures show that the vaccines are highly effective in preventing serious illness, hospitalization and death. The findings are likely to stir debate about whether masks, social distancing and other measures may again be needed even in countries with broad vaccination campaigns and where lockdown restrictions have eased. The CDC report said that universal mask wearing is still needed to reduce transmission in addition to vaccines. The New York Times, which also reported the contents of the document, said the agency\u2019s reverse course this week on masking guidelines for fully vaccinated Americans was based on the report. Israel recently reinstated mask-wearing requirements indoors and requires travelers to quarantine upon arrival. \u201cThe main thing that does change (because of Delta) is that masks will still be used and that in countries where this requirement has been lifted, it will have to be re-introduced,\u201d said Carlo Federico Perno, Head of Microbiology and Immunology Diagnostics at Rome\u2019s Bambino Ges\u00f9 Hospital. New research showed the vaccinated people infected with the Delta variant carried tremendous amounts of the virus in the nose and throat, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told the Times. The Delta variant is more transmissible than the SARS-CoV-2 ancestral strain as well as the viruses that cause MERS, SARS, Ebola, the common cold, the seasonal flu and smallpox, the report said. It said it was as transmissible as chickenpox, a highly contagious infection common in children that causes itchy rashes. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t But the variant is roughly as deadly as the ancestral strain, whereas SARS, Ebola and other diseases had far higher fatality rates, the report showed. The immediate next step for the agency is to \u201cacknowledge the war has changed\u201d and improve the public\u2019s understanding of breakthrough infections as well as the big reduction in the risk of severe disease for vaccinated people, the document said. CDC is expected to publish additional data on the variant on Friday, the NYT said."},

While Health Minister Christian Dub\u00e9 told reporters in Montreal the government would unveil details of its plan next week, the hope is to start as soon as possible. \u201cIt will be a very nice Christmas gift if all our kids are vaccinated before Christmas,\u201d he said.

Dub\u00e9 is hopeful parents will get their children vaccinated and pointed to youth aged between 12 and 17 as a group to be emulated, citing high vaccine coverage. He also said Quebecers only had to look at what\u2019s happening in their own backyard to see the difference vaccination can make. In the province as a whole there are 71.3 active cases per 100,000 residents but that number jumps to 156.4 for 100,000 people in regions like the Eastern Townships where vaccine coverage, according to Dub\u00e9 is only about 10 per cent lower. Dub\u00e9 said the government is planning to vaccinate children at the province\u2019s mass vaccination centres and at schools."},

The government has already taken steps towards maintaining restrictions \u2014 last week it extended the state of emergency to June 2, paving the way for Premier Doug Ford and his cabinet to prolong the stay-at-home order under that declaration. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe are looking at things daily, what I do know is that we are going to have to see our numbers go down they are under 3,000 today which is encouraging and the numbers in intensive care are at 828 but that still is very high, and we need to see them go down more before we can change the stay-at-home order,\u201d said Health Minister Christine Elliott. \u201cThe medical experts have been very clear we need to stay the course for right now,\u201d she continued. Elliott wouldn\u2019t confirm exactly where the numbers need to be for the stay-at-home order to be lifted. Ontario Medical Officer of Health Dr. David Williams said at a press conference on Monday he\u2019d like for cases to be under at least 1,000 a day to see an easing of restrictions. Under the order, stores providing essential goods remain open but are only permitted to sell grocery and pharmacy items. Non-essential retailers are limited to curbside pickup and delivery. Restaurants and gyms are closed for in-person service. The province has also shut outdoor recreational facilities, except playgrounds, saying the measure is meant to discourage mobility at a time when residents are expected to stay home as much as possible. The government\u2019s science advisers criticized the restriction of outdoor activities, saying they will not control COVID-19 and disproportionately harm children and those who don\u2019t have access to their own green space. On Monday, Ontario reported 2,716 new COVID-19 cases bringing the provincial total to 495,019. The province has reported 8,327 total deaths since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The news comes as businesses including restaurants and fitness companies are calling on the government to allow them to open up. Global News has reported on several companies who have reopened or remained open despite the stay-at-home order. At a press conference on Monday, Toronto Mayor John Tory said he and other mayors from the surrounding GTHA have asked for clarification from the province to allow for businesses and companies to be able to make plans for the future. However, at the same press conference Toronto\u2019s Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa said that she would support an extension due to case counts still remaining high in the city. \u201cWe still face new daily cases in Toronto close to or above 1,000 a day. This reflects the nimbleness and infectiousness of the variants. We face a much different intruder than we used to,\u201d de Villa said, adding Toronto Public Health (TPH) has looked at the modelling as June approaches. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t De Villa said the projections suggest that if we maintain the current level of contact, the City could see 400 cases by June 1, however, if some restrictions are lifted and transmission increases by \u201cas little as 20 per cent,\u201d then case counts could be approximately 800 a day by June. \u00a0\u201cI am of the belief that there is little likelihood the facts will change sufficiently by May 20 when the current order is set to expire,\u201d de Villa continued. \u201cI believe we cannot vaccinate our way out of this third wave but vaccination will be a powerful launchpad toward a more normal way of living after this wave passes.\u201d \u2014 People want predictability about what comes next, says Tory. He says the province should be providing clarity to people about whether the stay-at-home order will get expanded so people can plan ahead. The GTHA Mayors and Chairs have asked for this as well. \u2014 Matthew Bingley (@mattybing)  \u00a0"},

Under the orders, which go into effect Saturday morning, religious gatherings in the southern health region will be limited to 25 people, unless the facility is able to physically divide their space to allow for cohorts. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Chief public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin said the\u00a0the gatherings will be capped at 25 per cent capacity to a maximum of 250 people, if physical distancing and cohorts are set up. Religious services that only allow vaccinated people can continue without restrictions, Roussin said, adding the new rules for religious services won\u2019t be put in place in areas of southern health near Winnipeg where vaccination uptake has been higher and caps on retail capacity have already been lifted. The southern health region has the lowest vaccine uptake in the province and has been a major source of hospitalizations in recent weeks. Meanwhile, restrictions coming into effect province-wide Dec. 6 will see proof of at least one dose of vaccine or a recent negative test required for those 12 to 17 years of age to take part in indoor, recreational sports. The tests will need to have been done within 72 hours before being allowed into a rec facility. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The testing will need to be done at participating pharmacies, and won\u2019t be allowed through free, provincial test sites, Roussin added. \u201cWe\u2019re all disappointed, we\u2019re all frustrated, that we\u2019re looking at further restrictions,\u201d Roussin said Friday. \u201c(But) We know if we don\u2019t take further steps we certainly are at risk of overwhelming that healthcare system again.\u201d Roussin showed new modelling Friday that says the demand for intensive care beds could soon reach a level similar to the height of the third wave last spring. He said the number of new cases reported daily have been rising in Manitoba over the last four weeks, most predominately in those aged 19 and under. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The modelling shows without restrictions Manitoba could be announcing 200 new cases a day by the beginning of December and ICUs could be seeing three new admissions a day by mid-way through the month. \u201cThat\u2019s not a sustainable number,\u201d Roussin said. Rising Covid-19 Case Numbers Bring Added Restrictions    \u2014 Manitoba Gov News (@MBGovNews)  Health officials reported 193 new cases Friday. Almost half of them were in the southern health region, which makes up 15 per cent of Manitoba\u2019s population. The province is also cancelling some surgeries to make capacity for the rising cases and a surge in ICU numbers, which is already happening. The cancelled health procedures will boost the province\u2019s ICU bed capacity to 110, officials said. There were 86 patients in ICU across the province as of Friday morning, including 30 as a result of COVID-19. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Health Minister Audrey Gordon says changes are needed to stop a rising number of cases and to keep hospital beds available. \u201cRising case counts and COVID-19 transmission in the province means we need to introduce new measures now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must be proactive in protecting our healthcare system and ensure we have hospital beds.\u201d \u201cOnce again we must ask Manitobans to do more to reduce the current COVID-19 case numbers and community transmission which in turn will help reduce the strain on the healthcare system.\u201d At a press conference Wednesday \u2014 as he announced   \u2014 Roussin warned Manitobans would soon face stricter public health orders, but didn\u2019t say what the new orders will look like or when they\u2019ll go into place. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Roussin said Friday all previously announced public health orders will remain in effect. Manitoba already limits access to venues such as cinemas, restaurants and pro sporting events to people who are fully vaccinated. Gatherings in private homes are limited to members of one other household if anyone in attendance is unvaccinated. In the southern health region, except for a few bedroom communities near Winnipeg, capacity at retail stores is limited to 50 per cent. Roussin hinted the province may soon do more to restrict transmission in people\u2019s homes. \u201cCertainly, we\u2019re giving thought to that. We know that transmission occurs within homes,\u201d Roussin said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThat mostly represents people who actually live together in the home \u2026 but we know transmission occurs in prolonged contact in indoor public places.\u201d The Opposition New Democrats said the government has not learned lessons from earlier pandemic waves. \u201cHere we are some 20 months into the pandemic and the government hasn\u2019t taken enough action \u2026 to scale up (intensive care unit) capacity,\u201d NDP Leader Wab Kinew said.  can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing \u2014 very similar to a cold or flu.

At the beginning of the month, the province announced vaccinated Albertans would be able to sign up for a unique QR code to use as proof of immunization. At the time, there was no secure app to scan the QR code \u2014 until now. Quietly making an appearance on the Google Play and Apple App store Tuesday, the Alberta government introduced its new AB Covid Records Verifier. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Starting Nov. 15, the QR scanner will be the only accepted proof of vaccination, according to the premier. \u201cWhen a valid QR code is scanned, a green checkmark will verify the proof of vaccination. It\u2019s that easy for businesses and Albertans participating in the REP,\u201d Kenney said. During the announcement, Minister of Health Jason Copping encouraged Albertans to get their new QR code \u201cas soon as you can.\u201d \u201cYou can download it or take a screenshot of it and you can also print it if you wish.

Meantime, Alberta is on track to spend more than $15 million to directly pay vaccine-hesitant residents to get the COVID-19 shot. The province says that more than 152,000 Albertans have signed up to receive the $100 preloaded debit card in return for getting the vaccine. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The card, along with other measures such as a modified vaccine passport, have lifted Alberta\u2019s numbers closer to national averages.

Five of the deaths were reported from the North zone, three of which had pre-existing conditions: two men in their 70s and a woman in her 80s. A woman in her 30s and a woman in her 50s with now known conditions also died. The rest of the deaths reported were in the South zone where all eight people had pre-existing conditions: a man and a woman in their 60s, four men in their 80s and two men in their 70s.

Speaking to family members of patients on the phone, tight regulations means that he\u2019s had to say no to visitations more often than not. \u201cIt hit me that a lot of these patients we look after often die alone, or die with only a few family members beside them,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s tragic.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Gaerlan works at the Royal Alexandra, one of Canada\u2019s busiest hospitals.

We all just want this pandemic to be over but it feels like we\u2019re far from it,\u201d he says.  have been working tirelessly over the last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, trying to keep people out of hospitals, treat positive cases, vaccinate people and educate communities, among other things. In comparison to the beginning of the pandemic, when   workers felt the \u201ctremendous support\u201d from the general public in the form of convoys of honking cars or free food, Gaerlan says the everyday frustrations \u2014 and the inability to keep up with   \u2014 make it difficult to stay positive. Tim Guest, the president of the Canadian Nursing Association, says critical care nurses working in the ICU, in particular, are facing significant   right now, similar to   nurses during the first wave. \u201cThey\u2019re demoralized. They\u2019re exhausted. They are at the brink \u2026 from witnessing so much tragedy,\u201d he says, adding that many nurses might exhibit post-traumatic stress disorder once the pandemic subsides. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t A   conducted by Oraclepoll Research found that of the 2,600 registered practical nurses who belong to the Canadian Union of Public Employees, more than half of respondents said they were coping \u201cpoorly\u201d or \u201cextremely poorly\u201d at work over the past year. Just over 80 per cent reported that their workload had \u201cincreased a lot,\u201d and over 90 per cent are worried about bringing COVID-19 home to their families. \u201cThey don\u2019t really like being called heroes,\u201d Guest says. \u201cThey are faced with the same kind of public stressors that everyone else is facing and when they go to work, their families are always at the back of their minds.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Gaerlan says the media missed the mark when labelling healthcare workers as the  , because it takes the onus away from the public. \u201cThe frontlines are everyday people wearing  , businesses changing their daily practices to accommodate regulations and people who are socially distancing,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially in the ICU, we are essentially the last line (of defence),\u201d he adds. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody else after us.\u201d Like many other hospitals in Canada, the Royal Alexandra has had to expand its capacity to accommodate an excess of patients. Gaerlan says some storage rooms have been repurposed for patient care, equipment is sometimes scarce and several patients with COVID-19 might have to be contained in a common area. \u201c(It\u2019s) an efficient way of looking after patients but it\u2019s at the cost of their dignity,\u201d he says, adding some patients are side by side and on life support. Though a lack of space can be remedied, the amount of staff remains unchanged, meaning the workload has been stretched to the max for many healthcare workers. \u201cWe\u2019re pulling nurses from other patient care areas like surgeries,\u201d Gaerlan says. \u201c(But) we\u2019re still pulling from a finite pool of nurses.\u201d Canada\u2019s   has been one documented over the past decade, but the extraneous circumstances of the pandemic have highlighted how grave the issue really is. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t A study of over 550 registered practical nurses conducted by the Service Employees International Union found that 94 per cent of RPNs regularly work short-staffed, and 72 per cent believe staffing is insufficient. Many nurses   leaving the profession once the pandemic subsides. Ontario   other provinces to send nurses, and even requested international help from the U.S. and the Philippines. Guest says there are enough internationally educated nurses in the country who are willing and able to help with the current crisis, but barriers to becoming a registered nurse in Canada need to be eliminated first. \u201cThey have skills that can be used \u2026 and we need to find a better way of supporting them so we can get them in the workforce,\u201d he adds. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Gaerlan\u2019s parents were both nurses in the Philippines. After immigrating to Canada, his mom took a refresher course so she could continue working in the field and she now works alongside Gaerlan at the Royal Alexandra. \u201cMy parents are caring and loving people and I wanted to follow in their footsteps,\u201d Gaerlan says. \u201cBeing able to say that I\u2019m (a nurse) really empowers me.\u201d Lianne Mantla-Look, a relief community health nurse in Yellowknife, has also been working alongside her mom as part of the COVID-19 immunization response team. Her mom is a retired language and culture coordinator, and they have both been working hard to translate information from English to T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb for   communities in the Northwest Territories. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of   out there \u2026 and a lack of trust in the healthcare system,\u201d says Mantla-Look. Being able to provide reliable information \u2014 as she and her mom are trusted by many of the Elders in their region \u2014 and the translation of health material, in general, is a step towards decolonizing healthcare, she adds. Many words are difficult to translate, however, considering there is no direct translation to T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb, Mantla-Look says. \u201cWords like Moderna, antibody and even COVID-19 \u2026 you have to completely break down one word into various different things to convey your meaning,\u201d she adds. One highlight for Mantla-Look has been going back to her community of Behchok\u01eb\u0300, where she grew up, to administer vaccines. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t She has been the only person from her community who both speaks her language fluently and works in healthcare, and so the Elders have always been proud of her, she says. \u201cThe Elders gave me a seal of approval \u2014 calling me the nurse who gives painless needles,\u201d she says. Vanessa Wright, a primary care nurse practitioner at Women\u2019s College Hospital in Toronto, also works at a refugee clinic and different shelters in the city. When working with communities, she says it\u2019s important to start from a place of cultural humility. \u201cYou have to approach it with the perspective that \u2018I\u2019m not the expert, the community is the expert.\u2019 And we try to find the model that works best for them,\u201d she adds. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Wright has also been administering   to undocumented workers at a refugee centre. COVID-19 has highlighted the diversity and breadth of the nursing profession, Wright says, bridging knowledge gaps to different communities that might be at greater risk of transmission. \u201cNurses are the real connecting piece across all these different silos within the (healthcare) system,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are the backbone of the healthcare system.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t When Wright is feeling overwhelmed or incapacitated, she says she reaches out to other nurses for support. \u201cI find a lot of gratitude and solace in that. \u2026 We are good at acknowledging the barriers and injustices and we find ways to bridge that,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we listen to each other.\u201d"},

While the vaccines are certainly going to help us, we just don\u2019t have enough of the population vaccinated right now to rely on that alone, so I think a hopefully short-lived circuit-breaking lockdown is probably necessary.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t It\u2019s going to take a little while for these restrictions to be felt in the health-care system, Smith explained, so she hopes the gravity of the situation is evident to Albertans. \u201cI certainly hope that people will listen,\u201d she said. \u201cI do think that the restrictions will be short-lived, and we will start to see a decline in cases, and then hopefully, we can get back to having a hopefully more normal summer.\u201d The province said the new measures apply to all Albertans, businesses, organizations and service providers in municipalities or areas with more than 50 cases per 100,000 people and with 30 or more active cases. They will be in place for at least three weeks. The following restrictions take effect May 5: Starting May 7, according to Kenney, kindergarten to Grade 12 will move to at-home learning until May 25. Effective at 11:59 p.m. on May 9: The government doubled the basic fine for violating public health orders from $1,000 to $2,000. Kenney said there will be tougher enforcement protocol for repeat offenders. Alberta Hospitality Association president Ernie Tsu said the up and downs of opening and closing have taken a toll on the industry. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cIt\u2019s going to be devastating for every restaurant across the province that has been scrambling the last two to three weeks to get their patios mobilized \u2014 a lot of money invested at that point and a lot of money that restaurants don\u2019t have right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s next to impossible for restaurants to stay alive on takeout and delivery.\u201d Jordan Sorrenti with Paddy\u2019s Barbecue & Brewery in Calgary is frustrated by the news after hiring more staff as patio dining was just starting to pick up with the nice weather. \u201cNow the third or fourth shutdown is just getting very tiring because I\u2019m trying to keep my staff employed, trying to bring new people on, and it\u2019s just really frustrating,\u201d he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t With NHL playoffs around the corner, it\u2019s another tough blow for patios. Edmonton\u2019s Mercer Tavern would love to stay open, and management says it put a lot of money into making it work. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate for us and the rest of the industry, for sure. Pivoting back to just takeout programs is difficult for a lot of us, especially with the investment we just made into patios and bringing our entire restaurant outdoors,\u201d said general manager Bryan Schmidt. \u201cEspecially the timing with coming into Oilers playoffs and stuff like that, you really want to be open. You\u2019re kind of chomping at the bit to have that kind of business back. \u201cWe don\u2019t ever want to shut down, obviously, but we\u2019re going to listen to what they have to say.\u201d This is the busiest time of year for Bunches Flower Co. in Edmonton, with Mother\u2019s Day approaching this weekend. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t It has hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of products in stores right now, and with retail being lowered to 10 per cent capacity, its Southgate location and others will be affected. \u201cIt\u2019s been a little bit like the   to try and get enough product and to get it here on time,\u201d said Sharon Armstrong, co-owner of Bunches Flower Co. \u201cI wish they had done this maybe in the depths of January when everybody was already holed up at home, and we didn\u2019t have the option of dining outside and doing all these other things and all these other holidays and graduations that are coming up now.\u201d Annie Dormuth, director of Alberta provincial affairs at the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, said the restrictions will continue to hurt small businesses. \u201cWe are really disappointed in the sense that new restrictions are being announced, and again, complete closure of some businesses. The premier earlier this evening or yesterday did not make an announcement on additional funding that would be available to help these small businesses,\u201d she said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Dormuth is calling on the government to introduce a circuit-breaker grant,   She said a quarter of small businesses across Alberta are on the brink of permanent closure. \u201cYou have to take into consideration a small business owner \u2014 they\u2019re a small business. That\u2019s their livelihood, it\u2019s their entire life\u2019s work, it\u2019s their retirement plan, and sometimes, they\u2019re even the sole provider of their family, so it is definitely a stressful time for small businesses out there,\u201d Dormuth said. \u201cThat is really why it\u2019s imperative that the Alberta government does step up here and provide additional supports directly to these industries,\u201d she said, citing fitness, hospitality and personal service sectors."},

The three-stage plan ends in lifting all public health restrictions \u201cin only a few weeks\u2026just in time for summer,\u201d Premier Jason Kenney said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Each stage will take effect two weeks after the vaccination and hospitalization thresholds are met. Stage 1 requires 50 per cent of eligible Albertans over 12 to have received their first dose of vaccine and that hospitalizations be under 800 and declining. Currently, there are 548 people in hospital and Alberta reached its 50 per cent vaccination milestone on May 18. On Friday, May 28, the first part of Stage 1 will come into effect. It will expand the capacity limit for worship services to 15 per cent of fire code capacity. The second part of   will take effect  , allowing larger outdoor social gatherings (10 people, with distancing), outdoor patio dining (four people from same household or close contacts), outdoor physical, performance and recreational activities are permitted (10 people, with distancing), personal wellness services (by appointment) and expanded capacity for retail businesses (15 per cent of fire code occupancy). Under Stage 1, wedding ceremonies can have up to 10 people but receptions are still not allowed, funeral services can have up to 20 people but receptions are still not allowed. Distancing and masking requirements remain. \u201cStage 1 is good news and it keeps people outdoors, where it\u2019s safer,\u201d Kenney said.  will take effect two weeks after 60 per cent of eligible Albertans have received at least one dose of vaccine and there are fewer than 500 people in hospital and that number is declining. Stage 2 is expected to come into place in  . \u201cToday, we sit at 58 per cent of all Albertans over the age of 12 having received at least one dose,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cThat\u2019s only two per cent \u2014 or about 76,000 doses \u2014 shy of our target for Stage 2 reopening. So, with almost 90,000 appointments booked for today and tomorrow, and taking into account a roughly four-to-five per cent no-show rate we\u2019ve seen lately, we could hit that trigger as early as tomorrow.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cSo that means Alberta would enter Stage 2 on or about June 10 as long as hospitalizations are below 500, a target that trends have us on track for.\u201d Stage 2 will allow libraries, movie theatres, theatres and arenas (one-third fire code capacity), gyms (solo and drop-in fitness with three-metre distancing), fitness classes (with three-metre distancing), restaurants and day camps to reopen. Outdoor gatherings of 20 people (with distancing) will be allowed, six people will be able to dine out together inside or outside (no longer restricted to their household only), retail and worship capacity will be eased to one-third of fire code occupancy and youth and adult sports will be allowed to resume. Personal wellness businesses can resume walk-in services. Post-secondary schools can resume in-person learning. The work-from-home order is lifted but still recommended. Outdoor fixed seating facilities can open with one-third capacity under Stage 2. Public outdoor gatherings can increase to 150 people (with restrictions). Under Stage 2, wedding ceremonies with up to 20 people are allowed. Receptions are allowed outdoors only. Funeral ceremonies stay at 20 people allowed and receptions are allowed outdoors only. Distancing and masking requirements remain in effect.  will come two weeks after 70 per cent of eligible Albertans have received at least one dose of vaccine. There is no hospitalization threshold for Stage 3, but rates will be closely monitored, the premier said. \u201cMost health restrictions, including the ban on indoor social gatherings, will be history,\u201d he said. \u201cAlmost all the health restrictions will be gone.\u201d The mandatory isolation period for those who test positive for COVID-19 will remain, as will some measures to protect continuing care facilities and hospitals. Stage 3 is expected to begin in  . \u201cFrom Stage 2, we\u2019d need to vaccinate another 380,000 over the age of 12 to reach the 70 per cent first dose threshold for Stage 3,\u201d Kenney said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cBetween May 27 and June 14, we have 404,000 booked appointments. If these bookings hold, even taking projected no-shows into account, we could hit Stage 3, with a fully open summer, as early as June 28. \u201cIf more Albertans book more vaccines more quickly, that day could even come more quickly,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cThat\u2019s just how close we might be, folks. It\u2019s up to Albertans now.\u201d \u201cYou can do your part to speed up the full reopening by getting vaccinated as soon as possible. We could be fully open in just over a month.\u201d Kenney said the mandatory mask rule will likely be lifted \u2014 perhaps with some high-risk exceptions \u2014 as part of Stage 3. The premier said the reopening strategy is contingent on Albertans continuing to get vaccinated. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the current restrictions \u2013 and who does? \u2014 the best thing you can do to end them is to get vaccinated.\u201d Alberta will take a province-wide approach to easing the restrictions and the rules will be the same in all regions, regardless of their vaccination rates, Kenney said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the protection of the overall population here, about 4.5 million Albertans. That\u2019s the science behind herd immunity when we look at the whole population. \u201cWe are concerned where there are pockets of below average vaccination. We will make special efforts to reach out in those communities with both information and vaccination opportunities that break down barriers.\u201d  shows the High Level region is only about 11.3 per cent vaccinated with one dose. Kenney said the government will encourage people in every part of the province to be vaccinated as quickly as possible but doesn\u2019t want to see certain areas be stigmatized. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get into a situation where we start shaming people or be seen as punishing people in a particular postal code or town or community because they\u2019re not getting vaccinated at the same rate.\u201d Health Minister Tyler Shandro added that the provincial approach is something Alberta\u2019s medical officers of health and public health officials have been looking at closely. \u201cWhen we take a look at the community protection that we need to be able to move forward in reopening with this open for summer plan, there may be regional differences, but what we need to be doing is looking at the protection of the community as a whole. \u201cThere may be some pockets where there might be smaller levels of vaccination and there might be cases in those areas as a result. But we want is for the cases, for the province as a whole, and how that translates to pressure on our health-care system.\u201d On Wednesday, 390 new COVID-19 cases were identified from 5,979 tests, putting the province\u2019s positivity rate at about 6.5 per cent. There are currently 10,953 active cases in Alberta. \u201cWe have seen a steady decline in new cases across the province, which is helping bring our active case count down as well,\u201d Dr. Deena Hinshaw said on Tuesday. Just two weeks ago, there were 24,962 active cases of COVID-19 in the province. Hinshaw called the decline \u201cremarkable.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Alberta\u2019s R value \u2014 also known as the reproduction number \u2014 was 0.67 from May 17 to May 23. As of Wednesday, 548 people were in hospital with COVID-19, 157 of whom were in the ICU. Alberta Health reported six deaths related to COVID-19 on Wednesday, two of which had no known comorbidities. They were Albertans between the ages of 40 and 90, from the Edmonton, Calgary and South zones. According to the province, 136 new variant cases were identified in the last 24 hours. With 3,460 active variant cases, they make up at least 31.6 per cent of all active cases. Alberta Health Services is no longer screening all positive cases for variants of concern.

The federal government announced its   on Wednesday, saying that public servants must show they\u2019re fully inoculated by Oct. 29 or face unpaid administrative leave. Disciplinary action is expected to begin Nov. 15. The policy also applies to those who work from home and outside of the country. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Furthermore, Canada will require employees in the federally regulated air, rail and marine transportation sectors to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 30. \u201cTo be clear, the policy as of Oct 29, if you want to work for the government of Canada, which means the people of Canada, you have to be fully vaccinated,\u201d said Deputy Prime Minister  . The mandatory vaccination policy follows up on a promise Prime Minister   made in August before calling the summer election. Public servants\u2019 vaccination declaration will be tracked and audited by individual departments, and managers can ask for proof of vaccination at any time. Employees who provide false documents will face punishment, including firings. People who have had only one dose will be given 10 weeks to get their next one before they are put on unpaid leave. They won\u2019t be allowed back at work until they are either vaccinated or the policy is no longer in effect. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Vaccination against COVID-19 will also become mandatory for anyone 12 and older travelling on a plane or train within Canada by Oct. 30. \u201cIf you\u2019ve done the right thing and gotten vaccinated, you deserve the freedom to be safe from COVID,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cThese travel measures, along with mandatory vaccination for federal employees, are some of the strongest in the world.\u201d Regarding travel, there will be a period during which people who are in the process of getting vaccinated can show a negative COVID-19 test, but that option will expire Nov. 30. Government officials said anyone planning a trip in the coming weeks should book their vaccine appointment now. Travellers caught falsifying documentation, as well as transportation operators who don\u2019t comply, will face discipline. Under the mandate, accommodations can be made for people who can\u2019t get a vaccine on grounds protected under the Canadian Human Rights Act, which includes certain religious and health reasons. But Trudeau promised exemptions will be difficult to obtain, and having a personal belief that vaccines are \u201cbad\u201d will not work. Other federally regulated workplaces, like Crown corporations and government agencies, will be asked to create programs that mirror the mandatory vaccine policy for their employees. Canadian Armed Forces members will also be required to be vaccinated. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Cruise companies will also be asked to implement mandatory vaccines for employees and travellers in time for next year. Stephane Aubry, vice-president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada (PIPSC), told The Canadian Press his union is concerned about how the accommodations will play out. His union doesn\u2019t plan on challenging the new policy, but they may have to file grievances on a case-by-case basis, he said. \u201cThis is a concern for us because it\u2019s pressure on the employees, and we will defend our members as much as we can,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers told its members that it will represent them through the grievance process if they don\u2019t get a vaccine. However, they warned the process could take two or three years and there is no court precedent that could predict the outcome. After being re-elected with another minority government, Trudeau has said one of his first priorities would be to introduce the mandate, as well as the vaccine policy for travel within Canada. Trudeau also said the government is almost done with its vaccine passport for international travel, and will cover the costs for provinces that roll out proof-of-vaccination programs. The government is also working on legislation to make it a criminal offence to threaten or harass health-care workers."},

As of Thursday, 69,989 residents have received a vaccine dose \u2014 approximately 56 per cent of the eligible population in the health unit\u2019s jurisdiction of Peterborough, Peterborough County, Curve Lake First Nation and Hiawatha First Nation. Of that total, 64,199 have received at least one dose, while 4,852 have received a first and second dose. Salvaterra anticipates the region to reach 60 per cent with at least one vaccine dose by this coming weekend. She said Ontario as a whole reached that mark on the long weekend which is Phase 1 of the three-step reopening plan announced last Thursday. During the health unit\u2019s Tuesday media briefing, Peterborough-Kawartha MP Maryam Monsef says the region should start receiving between 8,000 and 9,000 doses in weekly shipments of   vaccine until August. She and board health chair Andy Mitchell ask people to remain vigilant and to not take any progress on vaccinations for granted. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long journey but we are getting there,\u201d said Mitchell. The health unit says to date in May there have been 230 new cases of COVID-19, but the pace is not expected to surpass last month\u2019s record 353 cases. There were 105 cases reported in February and 225 in March. \u201cMay isn\u2019t as good as we had hoped but hopefully it will be less than April,\u201d said Salvaterra. For the week of May 17, there were 67 new cases compared to 91 for the week of May 10 and 57 for the week of May 3. Close contacts as of Monday dropped by 50 since last Friday and were at 324 as of Monday afternoon. Single-digit case days were reported over the weekend, leaving 89 active cases as of Monday. The B.1.1.7 remains as the dominant variant strain which is more transmissible, she noted. \u201cHopefully this means that the third wave has crested,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s too soon as we have yet to see the effect of this past long weekend\u2019s activities.\u201d \u00a0"},

{"title": "Over 3 million people have now died of COVID-19 worldwide - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted April 17, 2021 6:23 am", "body": "The global death toll from   topped a staggering 3 million people Saturday amid repeated setbacks in the worldwide vaccination campaign and a deepening crisis in places such as  ,   and  . The number of lives lost, as compiled by J , is about equal to the population of Kyiv, Ukraine; Caracas, Venezuela; or metropolitan Lisbon, Portugal. It is bigger than Chicago (2.7 million) and equivalent to Philadelphia and Dallas combined. And the true number is believed to be significantly higher because of possible government concealment and the many cases overlooked in the early stages of the outbreak that began in Wuhan,  , at the end of 2019. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t When the world back in January passed the bleak threshold of 2 million deaths, immunization drives had just started in Europe and the United States. Today, they are underway in more than 190 countries, though progress in bringing the virus under control varies widely. While the campaigns in the U.S. and Britain have hit their stride and people and businesses there are beginning to contemplate life after the pandemic, other places, mostly poorer countries but some rich ones as well, are lagging behind in putting shots in arms and have imposed new lockdowns and other restrictions as virus cases soar. Worldwide, deaths are on the rise again, running at around 12,000 per day on average, and new cases are climbing too, eclipsing 700,000 a day. \u201cThis is not the situation we want to be in 16 months into a pandemic, where we have proven control measures,\u201d said Maria Van Kerkhove, one of the World Health Organization\u2019s leaders on COVID-19. In Canada, a total of 1,106,066 cases of the virus have been reported, and 23,541 people have died. In Brazil, where deaths are running at about 3,000 per day, accounting for one-quarter of the lives lost worldwide in recent weeks, the crisis has been likened to a \u201craging inferno\u201d by one WHO official. A more contagious variant of the virus has been rampaging across the country. As cases surge, hospitals are running out of critical sedatives. As a result, there have been reports of some doctors diluting what supplies remain and even tying patients to their beds while breathing tubes are pushed down their throats. The slow vaccine rollout has crushed Brazilians\u2019 pride in their own history of carrying out huge immunization campaigns that were the envy of the developing world. Taking cues from President Jair Bolsonaro, who has likened the virus to little more than a flu, his Health Ministry for months bet big on a single vaccine, ignoring other producers. When bottlenecks emerged, it was too late to get large quantities in time. Watching so many patients suffer and die alone at her Rio de Janeiro hospital impelled nurse Lidiane Melo to take desperate measures. In the early days of the pandemic, as sufferers were calling out for comfort that she was too busy to provide, Melo filled two rubber gloves with warm water, knotted them shut, and sandwiched them around a patient\u2019s hand to simulate a loving touch. Some have christened the practice the \u201chand of God,\u201d and it is now the searing image of a nation roiled by a medical emergency with no end in sight. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cPatients can\u2019t receive visitors. Sadly, there\u2019s no way. So it\u2019s a way to provide psychological support, to be there together with the patient holding their hand,\u201d Melo said. She added: \u201cAnd this year it\u2019s worse, the seriousness of patients is 1,000 times greater.\u201d This situation is similarly dire in India, where cases spiked in February after weeks of steady decline, taking authorities by surprise. In a surge driven by variants of the virus, India saw over 180,000 new infections in one 24-hour span during the past week, bringing the total number of cases to over 13.9 million. Problems that India had overcome last year are coming back to haunt health officials. Only 178 ventilators were free Wednesday afternoon in New Delhi, a city of 29 million, where 13,000 new infections were reported the previous day. The challenges facing India reverberate beyond its borders since the country is the biggest supplier of shots to COVAX, the U.N.-sponsored program to distribute vaccines to poorer parts of the world. Last month, India said it would suspend vaccine exports until the virus\u2019s spread inside the country slows. The WHO recently described the supply situation as precarious. Up to 60 countries might not receive any more shots until June, by one estimate. To date, COVAX has delivered about 40 million doses to more than 100 countries, enough to cover barely 0.25% of the world\u2019s population. Globally, about 87% of the 700 million doses dispensed have been given out in rich countries. While 1 in 4 people in wealthy nations have received a vaccine, in poor countries the figure is 1 in more than 500. In recent days, the U.S. and some European countries put the use of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine on hold while authorities investigate extremely rare but dangerous blood clots. AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine has likewise been hit with delays and restrictions because of a clotting scare. Another concern: Poorer countries are relying on vaccines made by China and Russia, which some scientists believe provide less protection that those by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca. Last week, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledged the country\u2019s vaccines offer low protection and said officials are considering mixing them with other shots to improve their effectiveness. In the U.S., where over 560,000 lives have been lost, accounting for more than 1 in 6 of the world\u2019s COVID-19 deaths, hospitalizations and deaths have dropped, businesses are reopening, and life is beginning to return to something approaching normalcy in several states. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits tumbled last week to 576,000, a post-COVID-19 low. But progress has been patchy, and new hot spots \u2014 most notably Michigan \u2014 have flared up in recent weeks. Still, deaths in the U.S. are down to about 700 per day on average, plummeting from a mid-January peak of about 3,400. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In Europe, countries are feeling the brunt of a more contagious variant that first ravaged Britain and has pushed the continent\u2019s COVID-19-related death toll beyond 1 million. Close to 6,000 gravely ill patients are being treated in French critical care units, numbers not seen since the first wave a year ago. Dr. Marc Leone, head of intensive care at the North Hospital in Marseille, said exhausted front-line staff members who were feted as heroes at the start of the pandemic now feel alone and are clinging to hope that renewed school closings and other restrictions will help curb the virus in the coming weeks. \u201cThere\u2019s exhaustion, more bad tempers. You have to tread carefully because there are a lot of conflicts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll give everything we have to get through these 15 days as best we can.\u201d ___"},

In an email to Global News, PHAC said the country\u2019s surveillance data \u201ccontinues to indicate low rates of COVID-19 cases following vaccination.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The agency added, though, that only nine jurisdictions in Canada are currently reporting on \u201cvaccine history questions\u201d that contribute to the country\u2019s COVID-19 dataset. PHAC said as of May 13, 2021, a total of 13,461 COVID-19 infections were reported in those who had received their first vaccine dose. The agency said 64 per cent (8,565) of the cases were reported in individuals who were still within 14 days of their first vaccine dose. Meanwhile, 36 per cent \u2014 or 4,896 infections \u2014\u00a0 were reported at a minimum of 14 days after the person\u2019s first dose was administered. The agency said this reflects the \u201ctime period required to build partial immunity\u201d to the virus. PHAC said the 4,896 cases reflect 2.3 per cent of cases reported from the nine reporting jurisdictions since the rollout of vaccines began. The agency said out of the 4,896 cases for which additional information was available, 9.2 per cent of the infections resulted in hospitalization, and three per cent ended in death. PHAC noted, though, that because Canada\u2019s vaccine rollout has focussed primarily on older adults, the cases reported after vaccination \u201ctend to be from an older demographic.\u201d PHAC added that because of this, \u201ccomparisons should not be made between hospitalizations/deaths among cases following vaccination and hospitalizations/deaths among all Canadian COVID-19 cases.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Dr. Zain Chagla, an infectious disease expert with McMaster University, said these numbers are \u201cpretty remarkable.\u201d \u201cThis is good,\u201d Chagla said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at numbers in that 95 per cent plus ballpark in terms of preventing infections. Chagla said while some people may look at nearly 4,900 cases after the first dose and think \u201cthat\u2019s terrible\u201d\u2026 \u201cBut in the grand context, during the same time period, you\u2019re looking at 500,000 plus cases of COVID-19 outside of children, and only around 5,000 of them represented among the group that\u2019s had a first dose of vaccine that\u2019s 14 days out,\u201d he said, adding that it is \u201cquite encouraging.\u201d Between when the first dose of a vaccine was administered in Canada in mid-December and the end of April \u2014 around two weeks before May 13 \u2014 750,569 COVID-19 cases were reported. In the same time period, a total of 1,3420,198 doses of the approved COVID-19 vaccines were administered. What\u2019s more, the number of novel coronavirus infections after vaccination dropped even further among those who had received two doses. By May 13, 3.54 per cent of Canada\u2019s population was fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The PHAC data showed that as of May 13, 2021, a total of 740 COVID-19 infections were reported in those who had received both vaccine doses. The agency said 21 per cent, or 153 of these cases were reported within seven days of the individual\u2019s second dose. Seventy-nine per cent \u2014 or 587 cases \u2014 were reported at a minimum of seven days after the individual had received their second shot, which the agency said reflects the \u201ctime period required to build full immunity after two doses.\u201d \u201cThe 587 cases with full immunity reported reflect 0.3 per cent of cases reported from the nine reporting jurisdictions since vaccine rollout started,\u201d PHAC said. The agency said of these cases for which additional information was available, 5.5 per cent resulted in hospitalization and 3.5 per cent ended in death. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Asked why Canada is still seeing infections post-vaccination, Chagla said it\u2019s not \u201cunreasonable to have some breakthrough cases.\u201d \u201cNone of these vaccines (offer) 100 per cent protection against symptomatic COVID-19,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019d expect breakthrough cases.\u201d Chagla said, ultimately, that\u2019s not the point of the vaccine campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s that (COVID-19) becomes a manageable outpatient disease, that people aren\u2019t being hospitalized in droves,\u201d he said. He said what this data does is help to give a \u201cballpark sense\u201d of what is happening in the country among those who have been vaccinated. He said it shows that breakthrough cases are happening, but \u201cthey\u2019re much, much less likely than getting infected without a vaccine.\u201d On Tuesday the   in those who had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The CDC examined cases between Jan. 1, 2021, and April 30, 2021, and found around 0.01 per cent of people contracted the virus after full vaccination. The study said a total of 10,262 vaccine breakthrough infections had been reported as of April 30. Meanwhile, the CDC said as of April 30, approximately 101 million people had been fully vaccinated. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The centre said, \u201ceven though FDA-authorized vaccines are highly effective, breakthrough cases are expected, especially before population immunity reaches sufficient levels to further decrease transmission.\u201d The CDC added, though, that vaccine breakthrough cases infections occur in, \u201conly a small fraction of all vaccinated persons and account for a small percentage of all COVID-19 cases.\u201d As of Wednesday evening, 21,886,005 COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across Canada.

For the past week, the Interior Health region has seen a dramatic rise in case counts, which prompted B.C.\u2019s top health officials to hold a press conference on Wednesday. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, Health Minister Adrian Dix and Interior Health interim chief medical health officer Dr. Sue Pollock declared an outbreak for the Central Okanagan. This includes Kelowna, West Kelowna, Westbank First Nation, Peachland, Lake Country and local electoral areas. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThe increase has spread out,\u201d Henry said, adding the cases are seen mostly in young people. \u201cOver 50 per cent of the cases, as the minister pointed out, have been in this area.\u201d Officials noted there have been 240 cases in the region during the past week, and that the vast majority involve those who haven\u2019t been immunized or only partially immunized. Henry said the province no longer needs to take broad sector societal measures, but some measures are needed. The Central Okanagan restrictions include: The province said the measures will remain in place for at least 14 days and until the region experiences lower cases and higher vaccination rates. \u201cMore than 95 per cent of recent cases in the Central Okanagan are among people who are not fully immunized against COVID-19,\u201d the province said in a press release. \u201cThis is an important reminder that immunization is our most effective prevention against COVID-19.\u201d \u201cWe are seeing this mostly in young people and we know they have had less access to the vaccine. We are seeing transmission in the Delta variant which we know is more transmissible,\u201d said Henry. \u201cWe still need to take measures in those areas where we are seeing higher levels of transmission. Where we are seeing transmission is in pockets of people who are not immunized or under-immunized.\u201d Henry also said, \u201ctaking these additional measures will help us get control as quickly as possible.\u201d She also called it a \u201clocalized approach,\u201d adding they hope to \u201csee a rapid decrease in cases and get our immunization numbers up.\u201d Dix added they are seeing \u201csignificant transmission in the Central Okanagan health area at multiple sites. We are taking some action to deal with that.\u201d He continued, saying \u201cwe need to increase immunization levels everywhere in B.C.\u201d Interior Health is also encouraging people to wear masks outdoors if they\u2019re unable to distance and if they\u2019re unimmunized. \u201cMasks can also be very effective against the very poor air quality that we\u2019re experiencing right now (because of wildfire smoke),\u201d said Pollock. Masks will be optional for children less than 12 years old who are attending camps or other similar settings. Interior Health also said it will be reinforcing the importance of physical distancing, staying home when sick and seeking testing if symptomatic. Pollock also said with a number of businesses in the area have closed because of positive COVID-19 tests, IH will be increasing enforcement of the province\u2019s restart plan \u201cthrough additional outbreak control measures.\u201d Pollock continued saying \u201cwe will be following up with businesses that have three or more COVID cases linked to their establishment. And, if necessary, we will be ordering them to close.\u201d However, Pollock also said, \u201cthere will be discretion for some of these businesses to continue to operate if staff are immunized, and we will be working with them on a case by case basis.\u201d On Tuesday, Henry alluded to the possibility of putting in regional restrictions to manage the rising cases in the Kelowna area and the entire Interior Health region. \u201cI don\u2019t see us having to go back to the same across-the-board restrictions that we had in place even a few months ago, in March and April and May,\u201d Henry told Global News. \u201cBut I do see that it\u2019ll be individual level, local things will have to happen.\u201d As of Tuesday, there were 412 active COVID-19 cases in Interior Health, more than double the 196 in Fraser Health, which has the second-highest number of active cases in the province. The surge in cases in B.C.\u2019s Interior is being driven by young people who are unvaccinated. The majority of the new cases are linked to those in their 20s and 30s. The positivity rate has soared in Interior Health, up to 6.8 per cent from 2.7 per cent a week ago. The outbreaks are being driven by the Delta variant and are connected to indoor, social gatherings. \u00a0"},

It is clear for the last month or so on this file (that) our government has been grasping and struggling, just trying to get some good news out of something,\u201d he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cTo say we don\u2019t want to know who has the coronavirus, we don\u2019t want to track outbreaks. Even the most fervent of the anti-maskers wouldn\u2019t say (to) unleash people who are actually infectious into the population.\u201d Nenshi said he worries that the decision to lift the health orders is politically motivated and has nothing to do with science at all. \u201cThe only possible explanation here is a political one. It might be that they\u2019ve run out of money, but you know what? Don\u2019t spend $1.5 billion on a pipeline you know isn\u2019t going to get built if you\u2019re running out of money.\u201d"},

In and out of waves, each province has handled COVID-19 differently and has seen ups and downs. Now in a  , two provinces are in the national spotlight: Alberta and Saskatchewan. This summer, the two western jurisdictions eased nearly all protective measures as vaccine rates picked up. However since then, inoculation rates have slowed and new infections have pushed hospitals to the brink. Both provinces are preparing to back-pedal, but you can\u2019t \u201cjust magically put this genie back in the bottle,\u201d said Dr. Cory Neudorf, interim senior medical health officer with the Saskatchewan Health Authority. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Neudorf feels this is a teachable moment for Canadians. \u201cWell, as we\u2019ve learned throughout these other subsequent waves, the sooner you act when you see a wave happening, the better your response is going to be,\u201d he said. Both provinces have experienced surges in COVID-19 cases since lifting protective measures in the summer. On Tuesday, Alberta reported 1,434 new cases and nine deaths. In Saskatchewan, 508 new cases were logged and two deaths were reported. On Monday, Alberta\u2019s top doctor admitted the summer relaxation was a mistake \u2014 one she \u201cdeeply regrets.\u201d \u201cI think that trajectory was set when we removed all the public health restrictions at the beginning of July,\u201d Dr. Deena Hinshaw said in a call with the Calgary Primary Health Care Network. \u201cBecause whether or not it was my intention, what was heard at the end of July was: \u2018COVID\u2019s over, we can walk away and ignore it.\u2019 And that has had repercussions.\u201d As Alberta made the move to loosen up in the summer, the province\u2019s weekly average in new daily cases was declining. On July 1, Alberta unveiled its \u201cOpen for Summer\u201d plan  which decided to ease measures, like ending asymptomatic testing and no longer notifying close contacts of exposure. At that time  the weekly average was 57 new cases a day. That number continued to decline until July 22, when the average shifted to 61 new cases over seven days. On Aug. 1, the weekly average moved to 178 new cases per day; by Sept. 1, that weekly average was at 1,082 new cases a day. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Dr. Paul Parks, president of emergency medicine at the Alberta Medical Association and an emergency medicine physician in Medicine Hat, told Global News he\u2019s seeing \u201cthe regular onslaught\u201d of COVID-19 patients coming in, the majority of them unvaccinated. \u201cThankfully, lots of them are well enough that they can be sent home,\u201d he said. \u201cBut more and more now are needing to be hospitalized, so our COVID wards are filling up.\u201d To deal with the influx, Parks said his hospital is cancelling or postponing surgeries \u2013 a move other hospitals across the country have done multiple times during the pandemic. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t While the mask mandate has returned to Alberta, albeit with exemptions, Parks said it\u2019s far from enough. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really implemented any really strategic targeted public health measures that will stop the onslaught and slow the number of cases we have right now,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than a mask mandate and asking people nicely to not congregate or drink after 10 p.m., Alberta hasn\u2019t done anything to slow this curve.\u201d Things have taken a turn for the worst in neighbouring Saskatchewan, as well. On July 11, the province decided to ease public health measures, including indoor mask wearing, but the government said unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people should still consider face coverings. At that time, the weekly average for daily case counts sat at a meager 43. The rolling average continued to dip in the days after, but began to climb back up by the end of the month. On Aug. 1, 55 new cases were reported daily over a week; on Sept. 1, the weekly average was at 263 new cases a day. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t On Monday, Saskatchewan re-enacted an emergency order to deal with a surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. The order, which ended July 11, gives the government the power to redirect health-care workers to areas experiencing pressure from the virus. Last Friday, Premier Scott Moe introduced a new public health order to help calm the spike: Unvaccinated people who are in close contact with a COVID-19 case must self-isolate for 10 days, while a vaccinated person need only self-monitor. University of Saskatchewan epidemiologist Nazeem Muhajarine told Global News recently that he believed the spike was a direct result of the July 11 reopening. Since then, he said, vaccination rates have slowed and many Saskatchewan residents attended group events during the summer \u2013 allowing Delta to spread. For Neudorf, this moment in time reinforces that the pandemic is an ongoing threat. \u201cAdvice that might have been given months ago has to be re-evaluated in light of what the pandemic is throwing at us right now,\u201d he said. \u201cFighting this pandemic requires a layered response, or   recognizing that every restriction or protection that we put in place has holes in it.\u2026 You need multiple layers of protection to get a handle on this.\u201d Vaccines are an important layer, he said, but relying solely on immunization right now is not a sound strategy as vaccines don\u2019t provide 100 per cent protection or prevent transmission. Other layers needed include mandatory masking in public spaces, restricting non-essential gatherings and proof of immunization. \u201cCertain types of activities have a far higher risk of transmission, either leading to a superspreader event or exposing people who are more vulnerable in our community.\u2026 We should be trying to do all we can to make sure that\u2019s a safe environment, and that includes immunization of the workers who work with those people and greater care with infection control in those situations,\u201d he said. \u201cSo those are the kinds of lessons that we need to draw. Some of those things aren\u2019t available in Alberta and Saskatchewan right now, coupled with lower immunization rates, and that\u2019s just created an environment for a rapid explosion of COVID cases again.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Both Neudorf and Parks want their provincial governments to act quickly. For Parks, his hospital is beginning to transfer patients around Alberta to free up space, but he fears if COVID-19 cases continue to rise, the health-care system will be pushed past the brink. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re begging our leadership to do something to implement targeted public health measures,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re asking the public to do their part, to wear masks, avoid big groups and get vaccinated. We need help.\u201d"},

The emails provide new details on how Tendercare Living Centre \u2014 a long-term care home in Scarborough \u2014   to use the building\u2019s fourth floor to isolate infected residents. The COVID-19 outbreak began on Dec. 4, 2020, at Tendercare and would become the deadliest in the province. According to the emails, officials from Scarborough Health Network (SHN) and TPH were notified by Tendercare on Dec. 11 that the home\u2019s original plan to separate infected residents by moving them to a vacant wing on the fourth floor would not be ready for a \u201cvariety of reasons, such as no call bells and no curtains.\u201d \u201cThe suggestions by TPH and SHN to address these issues were baby monitors for no call bells and room dividers for the lack of curtains,\u201d a media relations advisor with the City of Toronto, said in draft responses to questions from Global News dated April 20, 2021. \u201cThese suggestions were not agreed upon by the facility.\u201d The draft responses were never sent to Global News and were obtained under freedom-of-information legislation. Extendicare said it did not have the \u201cstaffing resources\u201d to open the fourth floor. \u201cThis was not one singular outbreak in isolation. Rather, it was one of many outbreaks at the height of the province\u2019s second wave, at a time when the health system was entirely overrun.\u201d Dr. Nathan Stall, a geriatrician at Toronto\u2019s Sinai Health, said some hospitals used baby monitors as a way for staff to communicate with patients and reduce exposure to staff. \u201cIt seems to me a potential missed opportunity to be able to isolate the infected residents or cohort the uninfected residents on the fourth floor to try and protect them.\u201d Extendicare, which manages the home, did not respond to questions concerning the claim by Toronto Public Health that it refused advice from health officials related to the baby monitors and dividers to help open the isolation wing. The company, one of the largest long-term care providers in Canada, said that both Scarborough Health Network and TPH did not have the \u201cresources\u201d\u00a0 or \u201cadditional staff\u201d to help support the home as the outbreak spread rapidly in December. \u201cThe home\u2019s staff levels were seriously reduced due to illness. As such, we did not have the resources to open the floor,\u201d Extendicare said in a statement. Scarborough Health Network did not respond to multiple requests for comment. On Christmas Day, three weeks after the outbreak began and with 164 COVID-19 cases, North York General Hospital took full control of the home after a request was approved by the province. A Global News investigation in May revealed allegations that chaos and lack of preparedness inside the home contributed to the deadly COVID-19 outbreak, even though management had told public health agencies in writing, several months earlier, that it was ready for the second wave. Documents and interviews with families, physicians, and people who work inside Tendercare showed that although the home had outlined a plan to Public Health Ontario nearly nine months before the December outbreak, the intended isolation rooms of the home were never used. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it was not prepared,\u201d one personal support worker told Global News. \u201cThey were just talking, but there was nothing being done.\u201d One doctor who volunteered to go inside the home said it was \u201cshocking\u201d to see the state of the home \u2014 months into a pandemic \u2014 and said there appeared to be no \u201coverarching plan of management from a medical perspective.\u201d Extendicare has said it \u201ccategorically\u201d disagreed with the doctor\u2019s assessment. The newly obtained emails also reveal mounting friction between public health officials and Tendercare and a lack of clarity over who was leading the response to the growing outbreak, which appeared to lead to delays in implementing infection prevention measures. \u201cDespite repeated recommendations made to the facility to use the 4th floor for cohorting, effective cohorting did not begin until December 17, 2020, when the new leadership at Tendercare was brought in,\u201d read the email from Toronto Public Health. And while Extendicare has claimed repeatedly that cohorting efforts were \u201cguided\u201d by TPH, the emails from TPH suggest the home was reluctant to accept infection prevention advice. \u201cWe continued to recommend cohorting on the 4th floor, however, the facility would not respond to this recommendation,\u201d a TPH spokesperson said. \u201cAs a result, TPH proposed an alternative co-horting strategy that included using the 2nd and 3rd floors where residents were already living.\u201d Toronto Public Health ultimately issued a rare public health order on Dec. 18, directing the home on how to manage the outbreak, which included separating COVID-19 positive and negative residents and providing staff with training on infection prevention and control. The health agency also pushed back against the long-term care home\u2019s assertion that the health unit didn\u2019t provide \u201cstaff\u201d to help with the outbreak. \u201cLocal public health units\u2019 mandate does not provide human resources/staffing to long-term care homes such as Tendercare,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cTPH does not employ the specialized staff such as personal support workers (PSWs) that would qualify to work in long-term care homes.\u201d The tragedy at Tendercare became a grim example of the situation in Ontario\u2019s long-term care sector, where more residents died in the second wave than in the first \u2014 a scathing indictment of how the Ford government failed to act on calls for help related to staffing, infection prevention, and resident overcrowding. Ontario\u2019s new long-term care minister, Rod Phillips, who replaced embattled MPP Merrilee Fullerton,   for a provincial pandemic response that saw nearly 4,000 residents and 11 staff die from COVID-19. Philips said a new Ontario Long-Term Care Act, to be introduced this fall, will create a framework with implications for operators who fail to meet their obligations. \u201cSuccessive governments, including this one, failed residents, they failed families and they failed our staff. On behalf of both past governments and the current government, I apologize for that.\u201d The province\u2019s damning Long-Term Care COVID-19 Commission report, issued at the end of April, found Ontario was not prepared to respond to a pandemic and had no plan to protect residents in long-term care after years of neglect by past and present governments. Philips said he would hold long-term care homes \u201caccountable\u201d and ensure home inspections that are more proactive could be included in the legislation. Asked whether the legislation would include fines for operators who repeatedly break the law, which was recommended in a recent Auditor General\u2019s report, a spokesperson for the ministry of long-term care was non-committal, saying that enforcement options were still being considered, including \u201cfinancial penalties.\u201d"},

Most indoor social gatherings are banned and theatres, cinemas, casinos and concert venues remain closed. But under a reopening plan announced earlier this month, health officials said they would look at gradually loosening restrictions if certain vaccination milestones are hit over the summer, provided daily case numbers and hospitalization rates have also fallen. Officials said Monday the first milestone \u2014 70 per cent of Manitobans aged 12 and up having their first dose and 25 per cent having their second \u2014 has been achieved earlier than the original July 1 target. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t That means plans to loosen COVID-19 restrictions can happen earlier too, Pallister said Wednesday. Under the updated public health orders restaurants and bars can open at 25 per cent capacity indoors, and 50 per cent capacity for outdoor dining. Those dining indoors must be from the same household, but those rules will be waived if all patrons at the table are fully vaccinated. Outdoor dining at bars and restaurants will see tables limited to a maximum of eight patrons, all of whom can be from different households, regardless of immunization status. Limits on outdoor gathering sizes on private property increase to 10 people and will allow for visitors to briefly access homes for \u201cessential activities,\u201d like using the washroom, Roussin said. The cap on public outdoor gathering sizes will increase to 25 people, and retail businesses will have capacity limits increased to 25 per cent to a limit of 250 people. A restriction on the number of household members allowed to shop together will also be lifted. Personal services businesses such as hair and nail salons, estheticians, and barbers will be allowed to reopen at 50 per cent capacity, on an appointment basis only. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Indoor faith-based services and gatherings such as pow wows and sun dance ceremonies will be allowed to resume at 25 per cent capacity with a limit of 25 people as long as masks are worn at all times. Outdoor weddings and funerals will have capacity limits raised to 25 people plus a photographer and officiants, while indoor weddings and funerals will remain capped at 10 people. Indoor dance, music and theatre classes and other organized sports and recreation activities will be allowed at 25 per cent capacity, to a limit of five people, while those groups will be now allowed to hold outdoor activities for groups up to 25 people.

Roussin said people must remain cautious because COVID-19 is still spreading in the community. \u201cThis pandemic is certainly not over.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Under the province\u2019s broader reopening plan, dubbed 4-3-2-One Great Summer Reopening Path, openings will increase to 50 per cent capacity, and gathering sizes limits will be again increased if the province hits 75 per cent first dose vaccination and 50 per cent second dose rates by the August long weekend. Finally, if 80 per cent of the eligible population has received one shot and 75 per cent has received two shots by Labour Day, the province will open businesses, services and facilities fully, with some restrictions. The province said an earlier reopening plan may be considered if goals are met earlier and case counts remain low. Pallister also dangled the possibility that those who are fully vaccinated would be free of certain restrictions as the plan moves forward. A provincial release said more benefits for the fully vaccinated will be announced in July, including increased capacity for fully immunized people at weddings, funerals, faith-based and other gatherings based on \u201ccontinued vaccination rate increases and improvements in the province\u2019s overall COVID-19 situation.\u201d Manitoba had 1,789 active COVID-19 cases Wednesday and the provincial five-day test positivity rate is 7.1 per cent.

Vaccinating this group will enable a safer reopening of schools, a return to normalcy as well as control the disease\u2019s spread to more vulnerable adults, experts say. \u201cKids are largely asymptomatic and so they will be transmitting the virus and they\u2019ll remain reservoirs of the virus,\u201d said Fatima Kakkar, a pediatric infectious diseases physician at CHU Sainte-Justine in Montreal. While children are less likely to experience serious symptoms of COVID-19, the disease is not entirely benign in them, she told Global News. \u201cWe do have cases of what we call the post-COVID syndrome, multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which can be quite severe, bring kids to the hospital, the intensive care unit. And so for their own health themselves, (the vaccine is) important. Human testing in clinical trials are divided into three phases. Phase 1 and 2 trials involve 10 to 100 healthy volunteers and focus on adverse events and immune response. Phase 3 trials recruit thousands of participants, where they receive either the vaccine or a placebo. It is only the Phase 3 trials that can provide a pivotal demonstration that a vaccine both works and is safe, according to  Children also undergo three phases of the vaccine trials, but the sample size is not as large. Because the efficacy of vaccines has already been tested in large-scale clinical trials among the adult population, the same steps are not needed for children. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cSome of the work has been done already in adults, so you don\u2019t need to have 40,000 people to prove that the vaccine works,\u201d said Anna Banerji, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at the University of Toronto. Instead, the pediatric trials focus on the specific dosage needed. These are called dose escalation studies. \u201cWe want to use the lowest amount of dosage possible to produce the immune response which will result in protection against severe COVID,\u201d said Kakkar. The biggest burden of COVID-19 disease has been on the elderly, who are at a higher risk of hospitalization and death. Because there was a greater urgency to vaccinate the seniors and adult population, children were not included in the initial stages of the COVID-19 vaccine trials. Another reason for the exclusion was safety. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that the vaccines were safe in adults, first of all, before applying them for use in children,\u201d said Jesse Papenburg, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and medical microbiologist at the Montreal Children\u2019s Hospital of McGill University Health Center. Children tend to have a much stronger immune response than adults, which is why they can\u2019t be given the same dose as adults, because they might react at a much higher level, said Kakkar. Papenburg said because children are smaller they oftentimes don\u2019t need as large a dose to elicit a good immune response. According to data from the Pfizer\u2019s Phase 3 trials conducted in adults, which included over 2,000 participants between 12 and 15 years of age, the safety profile of the vaccine in the adolescents was similar as for older people. \u201cThe most commonly reported side effects were temporary and mild, like a sore arm, chills or fever,\u201d Health Canada\u2019s chief medical advisor Dr. Supriya Sharma said during a   on July 15 found that the Pfizer vaccine in 12-to-15-year-old recipients had a favorable safety profile, produced a greater immune response than in young adults, and was highly effective against COVID-19. In general, young adults and adolescents tend to experience more side effects, which are brief and easily manageable, said Papenburg. Meanwhile, there have been   after COVID-19 vaccines predominantly among male adolescents and young adults in the   and  . \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Banerji said while the cases of   were mild and rare, they should be monitored closely. As for younger kids, Kakkar said there haven\u2019t been \u201cany major signals or safety concerns coming out of the Pfizer or the Moderna trials.\u201d Both\u00a0Pfizer and Moderna\u00a0started trials of their COVID-19 vaccines for children under the age 12 years in March. According to the drug makers, results are expected in the fall. But before the shots can be doled out, Health Canada has to review the applications. Back in May, Health Canada\u2019s Sharma said that Pfizer had signalled that they may be giving the agency a submission for the younger age groups of five to 11 \u201cas soon as September\u201d. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t If the data looks good, then Canada could potentially have a COVID-19 vaccine approved for use for that age group as early as fall. Trials are also under way for children aged two to four, but those results are not expected until the end of the year, said Papenburg. \u201cFor infants, we\u2019re probably looking at the first or second quarter of 2022,\u201d he added."},

The province reported nine new COVID-19 cases \u2014 six cases were in Zone 1 (Moncton region) and three cases were in Zone 3 (Fredericton region). \n\t\t\t \n\t\t All cases are either travel-related or close contacts of previously-reported cases. There are now 134 active cases, including 10 New Brunswickers who are isolating outside of the province. On the vaccination front, more than 55 per cent of New Brunswickers over the age of 12 have received at least one dose of a vaccine. Higgs told reporters it\u2019s expected 60 per cent will have received at least one dose by the end of this week. More than 60,500 people were vaccinated in New Brunswick last week. So far, 79 per cent of those aged 50 and older have been vaccinated. In the 60 and older age group, that figure is almost 86 per cent. While Russell and Higgs both pointed to the success of the province\u2019s vaccination program as key to moving to the \u201cgreen\u201d alert level, they also warned it\u2019s important for people to keep following public health directions: wear masks, maintain social distance, wash hands and use sanitizer. Doing so, said Higgs, will ensure New Brunswick can have a summer with fewer restrictions. \u201cWe have made tremendous progress but it is important to remember there is continued work to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m convinced we will be successful and we will see our province open up as we start the summer.\u201d Higgs said the province is currently forming its \u201cpath to green\u201d level plan and will reveal details soon. There have been a growing list of cases and public exposures in Fredericton. Russell said most of the cases in the city can now be linked to each other or directly to travel. On Monday night, the province said two cases were confirmed at Priestman Street School. Students, staff and their families have been asked to self-isolate until 11:59 p.m. on Thursday. Tuesday is an \u201coperational response\u201d day and students will learn online on Wednesday. Meanwhile, a second positive case has been confirmed at the Fredericton YMCA daycare on York Street. \u201cStaff, children and families who attend the child-care facility are advised to restrict their movements for essential services only for the next 48 hours to allow for contact tracing and to stay close to their telephone so Public Health representatives can get in touch if needed,\u201d the province noted in a news release. Close contacts of any cases will be contacted by public health. Public health has declared an outbreak at Ti Bons Soins, a memory care home in Shediac (Zone 1), after one confirmed case of COVID-19 involving a staff member. Testing of staff and residents is currently taking place. \u201cWe are working hard to protect our most vulnerable residents,\u201d said Russell.\u201cWhile vaccinations are helping, we must remain vigilant to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities.\u201d Russell said during the news briefing that anyone who has been at a potential exposure location, as identified by public health, should get tested for COVID-19, even if they have been vaccinated.

It comes as Alberta recorded 1,558 new cases of COVID-19 Thursday.  \u201cThank you to every single person that has gotten their shot, please encourage everyone you know to be immunized,\u201d Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said Thursday. \u201cThe response has been excellent and I want to thank every individual who is choosing to be vaccinated.\u201d So far, Alberta has administered 2,019,713 doses of COVID-19 vaccine and 322,247 Albertans are fully immunized with two doses. That translates to about 38 per cent of the population having received one dose of the vaccine and 7.2 per cent of Albertans fully immunized. \u201cFor those who are asking whether they should get vaccinated, the answer is yes,\u201d Premier Jason Kenney said in a news release Thursday. \u201cBy stepping up to receive the vaccine, we are protecting ourselves, our loved ones, our communities, and helping this province to move forward. The sooner we can get everyone 12 years and older vaccinated, the sooner we can put this pandemic behind us and look toward a brighter future for all Albertans.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Hinshaw said more than 328,000 shots are expected to go into the arms of Albertans in the next seven days. During a news conference Tuesday, Kenney said it took the province 119 days to administer the first million doses. Health Minister Tyler Shandro said it took 29 days to administer the second million doses. \u201cWe promised to deliver vaccines to Albertans as quickly and safely as possible, and we\u2019re keeping that promise,\u201d Shandro said in a news release Thursday. \u201cWith consistent vaccine supply finally arriving in Alberta and two million doses administered so far, we\u2019re another step closer to reducing pressure on our health-care system and getting life back to normal.\u201d By the first week of June, the premier said it\u2019s expected that half of the Alberta population will have received at least one dose of vaccine, and two-thirds will have that added protection by the third week of June. \u201cI feel proud of it and really joyful and obviously feel satisfaction in the heart that we are trying to help the community,\u201d Edmonton pharmacist Noman Khan said of being part of the two million milestone. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of just making money, obviously we are helping the community. The tough times, it\u2019s been over one year\u2026 lots of people are really hopeful.\u201d David Sleen has been working directing traffic at the mass vaccination site at the Edmonton Expo Centre. He said each passing vehicle gives him more hope. \u201cI love it. Each and every day I\u2019m here, the more people I see come in, it\u2019s one step closer to getting back to normal.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Ian Small became eligible to book his appointment on Monday,  . He received his first dose at the Expo Centre Wednesday afternoon. \u201cIt feels like kind of a culmination of 14 months of sitting here and waiting inside and being anxious and stressed and scared. Watching the numbers in Edmonton go up and finally now I can actually just get it. It\u2019s kind of surreal,\u201d he explained. \u201cTwo million is a pretty big number\u2026 I hope that most people will go get vaccinated and that number can just keep going up.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t While excitement around vaccines is increasing, the premier warned Alberta is still in the midst of the third wave and stressed the importance of everyone following the public health measures that are in place. Infectious diseases specialist Dr. Stephanie Smith also urged caution. \u201cI am a glass-half-full kind of person. I\u2019m an eternal optimist. I do think that we have a lot of hope in that we have really amazing vaccines, we\u2019re seeing very good supply of vaccines and good uptake in our vaccination. That, in conjunction with the restrictions that are in place right now, are going to get us through this third wave,\u201d Smith told Global News Morning Edmonton on Wednesday. \u201cI think that we have to be a little bit careful about being too optimistic about what the vaccines can do right now, because we still need to get a larger proportion of the population vaccinated before we can really ease those restrictions.\u201d Alberta\u2019s COVID-19 case rates are still the highest in the country. When it comes to where Alberta stands on vaccine rollout compared to other provinces, we\u2019re in the middle of the pack. Alberta is slightly behind the national average. All Albertans 12 and older are eligible to book a vaccine appointment, which represents about 3.8 million people. In response to high demand, the Genesis Centre vaccination site in Calgary will be expanding from 10 vaccination stations to 40. This will boost the immunization capabilities at the site from 60 vaccines administered per hour to 240 per hour. The goal is to have the additional spaces open by Saturday. Appointments must be booked in advance. Other provinces in Canada have been hosting pop-up vaccination clinics in COVID-19 hot spots. When asked if this was a possibility in Alberta, Hinshaw said it\u2019s something they are looking at but added there are many factors to be considered in that decision. \u201cWe have a finite amount of resources in terms of the vaccine we have available, the professionals who deliver it, the infrastructure that\u2019s needed to make sure that vaccines are within cold chain, that there\u2019s appropriate and prompt monitoring and reporting of vaccines administered,\u201d she explained. \u201cRight now, while we have extremely large volumes of vaccine coming into the province, we are wanting to make sure that we are maximizing the efficiency of our delivery, and as much as possible, supporting people to go to those locations that are nearest to them, which include pharmacies, some physician offices and the Alberta Health Services clinics. \u201cWe are looking at areas where perhaps uptake and coverage is not as high as we would like and it\u2019s in those particular areas where the possibility of outreach clinics could play a role. But we need to make sure that we\u2019re looking at that from a provincial perspective and making sure that we\u2019re considering all those who might benefit from it, as well as not diverting resources from the clinics that are providing access to the majority of Albertans.\u201d Earlier this year, Alberta \u2014 as well as several other provinces in Canada \u2014   vaccine to a maximum of four months. In Alberta, this applies to anyone who received their first dose after March 10, 2021. The move was made following a recommendation from Canada\u2019s National Advisory Committee on Immunization amid low vaccine supply, as well as evidence that showed protection against serious infection or death was present after the first dose. This allowed the province to offer first doses to as many eligible Albertans as possible, as quickly as possible. \u201cGoing from having no protection to having that first dose, which again offers approximately 70 to 80 per cent protection, is a very important boost,\u201d Hinshaw said Thursday. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Hinshaw has previously said   than the four-month timeline. She said Thursday that second doses could start being offered as early as the beginning of June, if vaccine supply keeps up. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be watching closely to see when our uptake begins to slow in those populations who are eligible for their first dose. If our supply of vaccine speeds up, again, it\u2019s a balance of making sure that we\u2019re opening up eligibility as soon as we have the supply to do so. \u201cMy estimate would be that by early June, I would believe that we would be able to start offering second doses if our supply arrives as we expect it to and if the demand continues as we expect it to for first doses.\u201d Information on how to book an appointment can be found on the  . With 1,558 new cases reported Thursday, Alberta now has 24,586 active cases of COVID-19 province-wide. That\u2019s down slightly from 24,962 active cases Wednesday. There are now 722 people in hospital with COVID-19, 177 of whom are being treated in intensive care. Hospitalizations are down from Wednesday when there were 737 people being treated with COVID-19. About 15,266 tests were processed, putting Alberta\u2019s positivity rate at 10.6 per cent.

This phase also includes indoor sports games and high-intensity fitness with safety protocols and up to 50 spectators for outdoor sports. The provincewide mask mandate, business safety protocols and physical distancing measures will remain in place. The earliest possible switch to the third step of the restart is July 1. The switch will take place if 70 per cent of the adult population has received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and cases and hospitalizations remain low. At this point, the province anticipates lifting the state of emergency and public health emergency. This will mean a return to normal for indoor and outdoor personal gatherings and increased capacity for indoor and outdoor organized gatherings with safety measures in place. Bingo, nightclubs, and casinos can reopen at limited capacity with safety plans in place. There could be new guidance around personal protective equipment, physical distancing and business protocols, the province said. The province is looking at fairs and festivals and inviting people from outside the province. There will be no group limits on dining at this point as well. \u201cThis is when I am hoping to get rid of all the public health orders that are in place,\u201d provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said. The fourth and final step could come into effect on Sept. 7 at the earliest if more than 70 per cent of adults have received at least one dose of vaccine and case numbers and hospitalizations remain low. This is a return to normal social contact. Capacity will be increased at larger organized gatherings and there will be no limits on indoor and outdoor spectators at sports. Concerts and professional sporting events can return with businesses operating with new safety plans. \u201cToday is a new day. We are one day closer to the light as we move into the last phase of our pandemic, we hope,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThis is a careful, four-step plan that brings us back to normal.\u201d"},

Here\u2019s what we know - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted June 22, 2021 12:59 pm", "body": "Fifty-year-old Diana Davison has not had a period for more than a year. So when she started experiencing bleeding 12 hours after her first   vaccine she was shocked. \u201cI started spotting, which is highly unusual because I haven\u2019t had a period for 15 months,\u201d the Toronto-based legal researcher told Global News. Davison received her primary dose of Pfizer BioNTech\u2019s mRNA vaccine on June 8 and experienced bleeding that day. By the next day, she said the bleeding was heavier. Concerned, Davison went to the emergency room, where she said she was dismissed when she expressed concerns about the bleeding being linked to her recent vaccination. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m not the only person in menopause who\u2019s had this happen. There must be something and we don\u2019t know what it is, then it\u2019s much more worrisome,\u201d Davison said. According to Toronto gynecologist Dr. Eliane Shore, post-menopausal bleeding can be a sign of something more serious. \u201cPost-menopausal bleeding is not normal and it should be assessed by a health-care practitioner,\u201d she said, adding causality can be hard to define. \u201cMaybe there is something with the vaccine \u2026 but also women and people, in general, may be highly vigilant after the vaccine and are reporting things that may have happened anyway.\u201d Worldwide, thousands of women have reported menstrual changes post-jab, according to various studies, but still only a small handful of research exists on the topic. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Dr. Tali Bogler,  , said the irregularities may be attributed to the body\u2019s short-term immune response. But, she explained the same cannot be said about women in menopause. \u201cIn the post-menopausal case, there isn\u2019t a good plausible biological reason why the vaccine would cause bleeding,\u201d she told Global News. Dr. Shore said post-menopausal bleeding can be a sign of anything from low estrogen in the vagina (vaginal atrophy) to uterine cancer. Both Bogler and Shore agree the lack of studies on COVID-19 vaccines and women is disappointing. \u201cWe haven\u2019t applied a sex-and-gender lens to a lot of our public health policies,\u201d said Dr. Bogler. In fact, while there are studies taking place in the U.K. and U.S. on menstrual changes after a COVID-19 shot, there are none in Canada, she added. In an April 2021 study out of the U.K., 958 cases of  , including post-menopausal bleeding, were recorded as adverse events. It also found twice as many cases of   with the AstraZeneca vaccine than with Pfizer \u2013 643 versus 315. That same month, an associate professor at the University of Illinois posted about her post-vaccine experience on Twitter. After receiving hundreds of replies from users who also reported similar menstrual changes, she started a survey that apparently garnered 22,000 responses. Meantime,   (who received Pfizer or AstraZeneca as their vaccine) in a separate report from the U.K. also found adverse effects are more frequently reported in younger individuals, specifically women. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t But reporting the changes in Canada isn\u2019t simple. The Public Health Agency of Canada\u2019s   document doesn\u2019t include a section for menstrual changes. \u201cBleeding\u201d is covered under the low platelets portion and is difficult to find. \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat infuriating, I believe, when I feel like I can\u2019t counsel my patients \u2014 on the full spectrum of potential side effects that could impact them,\u201d said Bogler. At the hospital, Davison said she was told what she was experiencing was \u201cannoying\u201d but \u201cnormal.\u201d She said she didn\u2019t receive any clear answers as to why she was bleeding. Davison said it wasn\u2019t until her first clinic visit that she felt validated. \u201cThe nurse \u2026 made sure my report would go in as an adverse reaction report,\u201d she said. Two weeks later, with no real answers, Davison is still bleeding. \u201cIt has a feeling to it. Like women are being told that they don\u2019t understand their own bodies and that they shouldn\u2019t \u2018concern their pretty little heads\u2019 over things,\u201d she said. She hopes doctors will take the concerns seriously so she and others can get some answers."},

The person who died was in their 80s and died in hospital, Premier Iain Rankin said during a news briefing in the afternoon. Rankin said he was concerned about the number of patients who are being admitted to hospital during the third wave of the pandemic. He said there are now more hospitalizations now than in the first and second waves of COVID-19 combined and said \u201cour system is under immense pressure.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cPeople are arriving to the hospital sicker, and later into their symptoms,\u201d he said, adding that people in hospital range in age from their 20s to their 90s. \u201cThese variants, as I\u2019ve said many times, do not discriminate in age groups,\u201d he said. There are 89 COVID-19 patients in hospital, including 29 in intensive care. Those numbers differed from what Rankin said during the news conference, but Dr. Tony O\u2019Leary, Nova Scotia\u2019s medical director for COVID-19 critical care, told reporters during a media availability later in the afternoon that the number of patients changes throughout the day. \u201cOur numbers can change rapidly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really do take these numbers hour by hour, but we\u2019re not going to update the dashboard in that kind of real-time.\u201d Nova Scotia Health president and CEO Brendan Carr said modelling suggests that in the coming peak of COVID-19 patients, Nova Scotia will have about 60 patients in intensive care and about 140 in acute care. That\u2019s within the health-care system\u2019s capacity, but will \u201cabsolutely\u201d cause stress on the system, he said. Meanwhile, there have been 151 new recoveries since Thursday, and the number of active cases in the province has dropped to 1,537. On Thursday, Nova Scotia reported eight cases in a non-COVID unit at the Halifax Infirmary site of the QEII Health Sciences Centre. \u201cAs a precaution, Nova Scotia Health Authority is testing staff and doctors who have worked in the unit,\u201d the province said in a press release. On Friday afternoon, Carr said it\u2019s unclear how the outbreak there started, but there are \u201cstrict and consistent\u201d protocols in place and any patient coming into the hospital is tested for the virus multiple times. \u201cA number of the patients that became positive had had negative tests done prior to coming,\u201d he said, adding it\u2019s possible for someone to initially test negative and later test positive. \u201cThe way that we are operating hospitals is, we assume that there\u2019s COVID all over the place. We have to.\u201d Carr said those patients have been transferred to the COVID-19 unit, and it\u2019s possible more people could test positive over the next few days. \u201cOur focus really is on containment and testing and screening,\u201d he said. None of those patients are in intensive care. The province opened up vaccine appointments for Nova Scotians aged 35 to 39 Friday morning, though the change wasn\u2019t formally announced in a news release until almost noon. People in that age range can book an appointment for a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine   or by calling 1-833-797-7772. Dr. Robert Strang, the province\u2019s chief medical officer of health, said during the briefing that 45 per cent of eligible Nova Scotians have received one or more doses of the COVID-19 vaccine so far. He said the province is expected to open up to more age groups and are looking at whether they could deliver second doses faster than originally planned. Currently, appointments for second doses are automatically booked 105 days after the first dose. \u201cWe have lots of planning to do before we can say for sure, and it will all depend on the steady supply from the federal government,\u201d he said. Strang also addressed people who have already received a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which the province recently said it would stop using. \u201cI know that many of you are feeling confused, angry or even scared. I understand that and I apologize if we contributed to this,\u201d he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u00a0 He thanked those who have received the dose of AstraZeneca and said it is still effective at preventing serious illness from COVID-19. He said the decisions the province made have always considered the risk of the vaccine, which can cause rare blood clots, along with the risk of COVID-19 and the availability of other vaccines. Strang said there have been no blood clot events from the vaccine in Nova Scotia. He said anyone who experiences a side effect should seek medical help. He said the province is committed to getting everyone who took AstraZeneca a second dose of the vaccine and are waiting for the National Advisory Committee on Immunization\u2019s recommendation on mixing vaccines. The province announced Friday that more businesses are now eligible for the  , which opened for applications today. Live performing arts organizations and independent retailers with a physical location, like bookstores and clothing stores, are now eligible to apply for the program, which provides eligible businesses a one-time rebate of a portion of their paid property taxes. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe have been consulting with the business community and listening to their concerns. The changes that we are announcing today are one way we are responding to that feedback,\u201d said Labi Kousoulis, minister of Inclusive Economic Growth, in a release. \u201cWe will continue to engage with our local businesses and work with our federal partners to support those in need.\u201d Eligible businesses can choose a rebate of $1,000, or 50 per cent of the commercial real property taxes paid for the final six months of the 2020-21 tax year. The eligibility change is estimated to cost the province $4 million, bringing the total cost of the program to $11 million. The program was previously open only to fitness establishments, hair salons, spas, nail salons, body art establishments and bars and restaurants."},

Currently, there are 257 Albertans in hospital, 48 of whom are in intensive care. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Kenney said pressure on the health-care system has eased and there\u2019s been a \u201csharp decline in people admitted to hospital and intensive care for COVID.\u201d Long-term care and designated supportive living facilities \u201chave seen cases plummet,\u201d he added. Actives cases in long-term care have now declined more than 95 per cent from December\u2019s peak, the premier said, and designated supportive living cases have dropped by more than 92 per cent. \u201cThis is encouraging data,\u201d Kenney said. However, officials are concerned with the R value, positivity rate, active case rates and the threat caused by variants of concern. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cAlberta is taking a careful approach,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cWhile our hospitalizations are dropping, we have seen the number of active cases level off recently and the testing positivity rate has risen a bit. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to proceed cautiously while still moving forward,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must take a balanced approach and move carefully and (stay) safely focused on the data.\u201d \u201cI have to stress the huge importance of avoiding indoor social gatherings,\u201d the premier said. \u201cNow that our contact tracing system is on top of new cases\u2026 we can see good data \u2014 about a third of the cases we don\u2019t know their source of transmission \u2014 but for over 30 per cent, we know they\u2019re happening at home, just like in the fall. So we need to be very careful about at-home transmission.\u201d Alberta is offering free, voluntary hotel stays with isolation payments to support people who can\u2019t isolate at home. \u201cWe need to be more careful than ever to not create opportunity for the virus and its variants to spread,\u201d chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said. \u201cThe progress we\u2019ve made is not guaranteed to last.\u201d This is Stage 2 of a four-stage plan to reopen the economy announced by Kenney a month ago. Step 1  , which saw restaurants reopen to in-person dining, one-on-one indoor fitness offered and some children\u2019s sports and performance activities were allowed to resume under some health restrictions. Alberta moved into Phase1B of its vaccine rollout plan last week, with vaccinations being offered to community seniors 75 and older. As of Monday, 235,000 doses of the vaccine have been administered across Alberta and 88,000 people are fully immunized. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThe game changer is the vaccine,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cIt is incredibly frustrating and totally unacceptable that Canada is ranked 40th in the world for per capita inoculation against this virus. \u201cWidespread use of the vaccine will mean freedom,\u201d the premier said, urging the federal government to \u201ccatch up with rest of the world in vaccine procurement.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Hinshaw said long lines at some clinics have been minimized by processes put in place by Alberta Health Services. She asked for patience \u201cas we work through some challenges.\u201d Hinshaw said people with vaccine appointments should wait in their vehicles and arrive no more than five minutes before their scheduled appointment time. \u201cIf you are comfortable going into your appointment alone, please don\u2019t bring a support person with you.\u201d She said seniors should wear clothing where it\u2019s easy to expose your arm. Albertans born in 1946 or earlier can book their vaccine appointments by using the AHS online booking tool, calling 811 or by calling  Hinshaw said Monday Alberta had identified 291 new cases of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours. Over the same time period, more than 5,900 tests had been completed, putting Alberta\u2019s positivity rate at 4.9 per cent. Thirty-five additional cases of the variant have been identified since Sunday, bringing the provincial total to 457. The R value for the province sits at 1.01. Two additional deaths were reported to Alberta Health in the last 24 hours. Both were linked to COVID-19 outbreaks and included comorbidities. A woman in her 90s in the Calgary zone, linked to the outbreak at Foothills Medical Centre, passed away. A woman in her 80s in the North zone, linked to the outbreak at Heritage Lodge, also died. \u00a0 Two doctors who co-chair the Edmonton Zone Medical Staff Association\u2019s pandemic committee made a plea for a more cautious approach in a statement released Friday. \u201cThe health-care system and the population, after having been stressed for so long, really can\u2019t tolerate another surge before the end of our vaccination campaign,\u201d said Dr. Noel Gibney and Dr. James Talbot, noting it will be months before all at-risk Albertans are inoculated. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cAny further easing of COVID-19 restrictions should only be undertaken when all high-risk individuals in the province have been immunized. We have a short window remaining to prevent another surge and protect Albertans, but it is rapidly closing.\u201d Ahead of Monday\u2019s news conference, Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi also stressed a need for a cautious move forward. \u201cYesterday\u2019s number, maybe it was a blip \u2014 415 new cases. But if it\u2019s not a blip, that means we\u2019ve quadrupled the number of new cases almost in just over a week. And so that\u2019s actually very, very troubling. And so if I were the provincial government, I might wait just a couple more days to see if that\u2019s a trend that is setting in, or if that was just a blip, before making any decisions.\u201d"},

Here\u2019s what we know so far - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted August 30, 2021 9:34 pm", "body": "South African researchers are raising concern over the spread of a new   variant riddled with a number of mutations, including some associated with increased transmissibility and a resistance to antibodies against the disease. The variant, named C.1.2, was first detected in May and has spread to a majority of South Africa\u2019s provinces as well as seven other countries, including China, Portugal and the U.K. In a   published by researchers at the Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa, the variant was described as \u201cconcerning\u201d due to the number of mutations it possessed. The study is yet to be peer reviewed. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t A   from South Africa\u2019s National Institute for Communicable Diseases pointed to the C.1.2 lineage as having mutations seen in other COVID-19 variants of interest or concern, but \u201calso other mutations which are novel.\u201d \u201cWhile the C.1.2 lineage shares a few common mutations with the Beta and Delta variants, the new lineage has a number of additional mutations,\u201d read the release. \u201cBased on our understanding of the mutations in this variant, we suspect that it might be able to partially evade the immune response, but despite this, that vaccines will still offer high levels of protection against hospitalization and death.\u201d Despite the scientists having observed such mutations in the variant, they have not yet concluded whether it actually is more contagious or is able to conquer the immunity provided by vaccines or previous infection. South Africa had been the first country to detect the Beta COVID-19 variant, one of the four variants of concern labelled by the World Health Organization. Characteristics associated with Beta include increased transmissibility, a higher risk of severe disease from catching the coronavirus as well as evidence of antibody neutralization, according to the WHO. Dr. Gerald Evans, chair of infectious diseases division at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ont., said it\u2019s too early to tell if C.1.2 could pose as much of a threat as that of Delta \u2014 an extremely transmissible variant which has driven new waves of the pandemic in several countries across the world, including Canada. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cI think probably the most impressive thing is that, you know, where it\u2019s been described in places, it is not able to outcompete Delta.\u201d Genomic sequencing data from South Africa places the spread of C.1.2 nowhere near that of the dominant Delta as of July. During that month, C.1.2 accounted for three per cent of COVID-19 testing samples in comparison to Delta, which account for 89 per cent in South Africa. The variant has also not been able to outcompete the other dominant variants of COVID-19 in the countries it has spread to so far. Richard Lessells, one of the authors of the South African report on C.1.2, told Reuters that the variant\u2019s emergence tells them the \u201cpandemic is far from over and that this virus is still exploring ways to potentially get better at infecting us.\u201d And while he pointed to C.1.2 as having more immune evasion properties than Delta in particular, he said that people should not be overly alarmed by its discovery, as more mutated variants were bound to emerge late in the pandemic. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The findings from the South African team have since been flagged to the World Health Organization (WHO). On Monday, the WHO\u2019s COVID-19 technical lead addressed the research and news of C.1.2 in several statements online. In a thread posted to Twitter, the WHO\u2019s Maria Van Kerkhove pointed to there being just about 100 sequences of the variant having been identified since it was first reported by South Africa in May.  has regularly been discussing with South African researchers about theirr work on sequencing throughout the   pandemic. \ud83d\ude4f We are grateful for researchers in \ud83c\uddff\ud83c\udde6  who first presented their findings on variant C.1.2 to the WHO Virus Evolution Working Group in July \u201821. \u2014 Maria Van Kerkhove (@mvankerkhove)  She pointed to Delta as still appearing to be the more dominant variant based on available sequences. Evans said he\u2019s going to be skeptical of the concern over C.1.2 unless he sees more compelling data over the next couple of months from South Africa or anywhere else the variant has spread to. \u201cI think when it comes to C.1.2, there\u2019s a lot of speculation saying, \u2018wow, you know some of these mutations we haven\u2019t seen a lot of, maybe they\u2019re going to represent immune escape or something,\u2019 but it hasn\u2019t been borne out,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Delta is going to outcompete it and it\u2019ll probably die off. That\u2019s my speculation,\u201d said Evans. \u2014 "},

Another 30 million Pfizer vaccines have been secured for 2023, he told reporters at a press conference. \u201cPfizer has been a solid partner for Canada in this fight against COVID-19, and we\u2019re happy to be one of the first countries to secure an agreement with them going forward,\u201d Trudeau said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The deal includes options to add 30 million doses in both 2022 and 2023, and an option for 60 million doses in 2024, he added. Canada expects to get every adult vaccinated fully \u2014 with both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines or one shot of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson \u2014 by the end of September at the latest. Teenagers likely will be vaccinated by then as well, but vaccines for kids under 12 aren\u2019t expected to be authorized until at least the fall. Still, many experts believe additional booster shots are going to be necessary, either to remind the immune system what it needs to do, or protect against some new variants of the virus that causes COVID-19. Health Canada has initiated a plan to authorize boosters without the same extensive testing required to approve the original vaccines, similar to how flu shots are authorized each year after being adjusted for the new strain of flu virus believed to be dominant. Canada has already purchased 117.6 million doses of the four vaccines authorized, which could fully vaccinate all Canadians once, and about half the population twice."},

The estimated figure, as cited on CIHI\u2019s COVID-19 Hospitalization and Emergency Department Statistics, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021, is about four times the cost of a regular hospital stay, which is $6,000. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t This can be attributed mainly to the \u201clength of stay and resources needed\u201d when a COVID-19 patient is admitted to a hospital, CIHI spokesperson Michael Hunt, director of spending, primary care and strategic initiatives, told Global News on Thursday. On average, COVID-19 hospital stays lasted about two weeks. \u201cA little over half the folks admitted to hospitals moved on to require even more intensive caring, and about 60 per cent of those also need ventilation,\u201d he said. For those requiring admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and ventilation, the cost went up to \u201c$50,000, which makes sense because of the more intense resource consumption\u201d needed during the stay, Hunt added. According to the CIHI report, there were nearly 14,000 hospital stays in Canada \u2014 with the exception of Quebec \u2014 for patients diagnosed with the novel coronavirus from January 2020 to November 2020, elevating the estimated cost of COVID-19-related hospitalization to more than $317 million during the same period. Usually patients \u201cwith secondary chronic diseases or what we call comorbidity\u201d were found more likely to be admitted into hospitals and \u201cthen once they were in there, they were actually sicker than other clients,\u201d Hunt said. The infections were \u201csignificantly worse\u201d in those with comorbidity, compared to the rest, he noted.\u00a0They were the ones \u201cmore likely to require hospitalization, more likely to need ICU and more likely to be ventilated,\u201d he said. However, for those not needing ICU admission, the cost of stay would \u201crun around $15,000,\u201d Hunt added. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t While medication costs are included in the bills, physician costs are not. This is typical of the Canadian health-care system since physicians are not paid through hospitals but are seen \u201cas independent business people,\u201d he said. Admissions to intensive care units, nevertheless, were lower by 22 per cent during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 to June 2020, as compared to 2019. Three-quarters of patients visiting hospitals with COVID-19 infections, \u201cactually went home,\u201d Hunt said, \u201cand of the remainder, only 20 per cent or so would actually get a hospitalization.\u201d While fewer people were taken into intensive care units for cardiac conditions, strokes or pneumonia, there was a notable spike of 41 per cent \u201cin the number of non-surgical emergency admissions for major respiratory conditions, mostly COVID-19 patients,\u201d according to \u201cCases with major respiratory conditions requiring ventilation, including many with COVID-19,\u201d rose by 129 per cent in April, but in totality, \u201c17 per cent fewer people required ventilation\u201d during the first wave compared with March to June 2019, the report said. However, emergency department (ED) visits decreased considerably in Canada from February 2020 to June 2020. While participating jurisdictions reported more than 85,400 ED visits for COVID-19 from January to November 2020, regular ED footfall dropped to their \u201clowest point in April,\u201d when compared to 2019, the report on the CIHI website further cited. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cLess urgent and non-urgent visits decreased the most, by about 50 per cent, followed by urgent and emergent visits, at just more than 40 per cent. Visits that involved resuscitation decreased the least, by around 30 per cent. All levels increased in June but remained about 20 per cent below normal compared with the previous year,\u201d the report said. The report also suggested that \u201cpreparations for a surge of potential COVID-19 patients\u201d such as additional screening procedures, and transferring those who could be treated somewhere else, \u201cmay also have contributed to the decrease in emergency department visits across the country.\u201d"},

They say the current infection control protocols in place don\u2019t adequately help to curb the airborne transmission of COVID-19 and that officials need to pivot to target the appropriate areas, like ventilation and proper mask-wearing. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe just need a sort of shift in our minds of how we view the way transmission works,\u201d said Brooks Fallis, a critical care physician and former critical care director at the William Osler Health System. \u201cI think people are quite fixated on hand-washing, two metres distancing and wearing some sort of face-covering \u2026 If you look at the transmission of COVID and say, \u2018You acquire COVID by breathing in infected air and infected air accumulates indoors,\u2019 I think it\u2019s easier for people to understand how they\u2019re getting infected.\u201d Nearly two weeks ago \u2014 and after months of heated debate \u2014 the World Health Organization (WHO)   that COVID-19 can be spread through aerosols in poorly ventilated or crowded indoor spaces since the tiny particles \u201cremain suspended in the air\u201d and can travel more than one metre. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recently   its guidance on COVID-19 transmission, saying, \u201cTransmission of SARS-CoV-2 from inhalation of virus in the air farther than six feet from an infectious source can occur.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t While these public health organizations have only recently updated their stances on the transmission of the novel coronavirus, some experts have long believed that people could contract COVID-19 through particles that stay in the air. \u201cBy acknowledging how COVID is mostly being transmitted, we can use the tools in the toolbox that we have to control an aerosol-transmitted disease,\u201d said David Fisman, an epidemiology professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Dalla Lana School of Public Health. \u201cWe can be more effective at disease control, and we can open up and relax some things that aren\u2019t going to create danger for anybody.\u201d For months, experts have said the risk of outdoor COVID-19 transmission is low. Several studies also back up this claim, with one   saying less than 10 per cent of reported global COVID-19 cases were acquired outdoors. The same research also showed the likelihood of indoor transmission is nearly 19 times higher than outdoor spread. \u201cPeople need to understand that outdoors is safe,\u201d Fisman said. \u201cYou\u2019re in a well-ventilated space with a breeze blowing. It\u2019s much harder for you to suck in the aerosol that someone else has breathed out.\u201d Fisman said opening parks, playgrounds and other outdoor amenities, including patio dining if it\u2019s properly spaced out, can be done safely. \u201cBecause the outdoors provides an incredible naturally ventilated space, we should be leveraging that a lot more and allowing people a little bit more freedom in the outdoors while still respecting the most important thing outdoors, which would be distancing,\u201d Fallis added. \u201cWhere distancing isn\u2019t possible, wear masks.\u201d In order to mitigate indoor airborne transmission of the novel coronavirus, experts say better ventilation is needed in buildings, homes, schools and workplaces. \u201cThis is a very old problem \u2014 we have always had this debate about many diseases, about what\u2019s airborne and what does airborne actually mean,\u201d said Jeffrey Siegel, a professor in the civil and mineral engineering department at the University of Toronto. \u201cEven without COVID, and in fact, maybe even much more than COVID, indoor air quality is a substantial problem already.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Siegel said ventilation needs to be addressed in many \u2014 if not most \u2014 buildings and that measures need to be put in place to protect people who need to be in close proximity with one another or without masks. \u201cObviously, upgrading every ventilation system in a short period of time is not going to be possible,\u201d Fallis said. \u201cThere are other options, like air filtration, things like HEPA filters or filters on furnaces, that will help to remove particulate as the air is being circulated.\u201d In some spaces, ventilation can\u2019t be increased, Siegel said, and in those cases, there still needs to be strategies for reducing risk. \u201cIt\u2019s very specific to the building,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have many tools in our arsenal, and it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all kind of approach.\u201d In addition to improving ventilation, experts say people need to wear more protective masks \u2014 like N95 respirators \u2014 in high-risk indoor settings where airborne COVID-19 transmission is possible. In particular, Fallis said people in hospitals and indoor workplaces, like warehouses or factories, need to transition to wearing a respirator-type mask. \u201cPeople need to be re-educated around mask-wearing because the current guidelines suggest that you can remove your mask in an indoor environment as long as you\u2019re distanced from someone else by two metres,\u201d Fallis said. \u201cIn a poorly-ventilated indoor space, it\u2019s very clear that\u2019s not appropriate guidance.\u201d While some people should make the transition to wearing a respirator mask, Fisman said not everyone needs to. \u201cI think the people that we\u2019re talking about are folks in the health-care environment who are overrepresented among (COVID) cases and folks who are in high-risk workplaces that are way overrepresented among cases,\u201d he said. \u201cFor those folks who are going to be sharing air for hours and hours and hours, yeah, absolutely they should be wearing an N95 mask. For a lot of the rest of us, when we\u2019re doing a jaunt to a grocery store and what have you, masks still help.\u201d"},

{"title": "What are the odds of a COVID-19 lab leak? Re-examining the virus origins theory  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted June 21, 2021 5:01 am", "body": "It almost seemed like a joke and far-fetched conspiracy to many \u2014 the idea that   could have accidentally escaped, or even been intentionally released, from a lab in China. Perhaps Donald Trump\u2019s   also pushed many to become disbelievers in the hypothesis. But recently, the lab-leak theory has made its way back into headlines as well as the minds of politicians and health officials. The resurgence of the lab-leak theory can be attributed to three key reasons. Firstly, U.S. President Joe Biden recently   into the origins of COVID-19. In a  , Biden said the U.S. Intelligence Community has agreed on \u201ctwo likely scenarios\u201d \u2014 human contact with an infected animal, or a laboratory accident. (Though neither one has been deemed more probable than the other, according to the statement). Biden\u2019s investigation comes just two months after the World Health Organization (WHO) wrapped up a probe of its own.   provided no definitive answers as to origins, but said the lab-leak theory was \u201cextremely unlikely,\u201d and needs to be studied further. The report concluded, \u201call hypotheses remain on the table.\u201d Since then, 14 countries,  , have   about the study\u2019s delay and absence of information. However, the WHO said its investigation was  despite \u201cvery strong, good collaboration\u201d from China.  withholding any data and maintains the study was transparent. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Either way, the launch of Biden\u2019s investigation triggered a reaction from Facebook.  it will no longer be removing posts from its site that claim COVID-19 is man-made. This is the opposite of what the company said it was going to do back in February. While some took to Twitter to say this move may perpetuate misinformation on the site or give the theory legs, Ryerson University\u2019s   says Facebook\u2019s decision is reasonable, given the ongoing investigation. \u201cAs we\u2019re getting evolving news stories that change as more and more information comes, it makes sense that an organization like Facebook would change,\u201d said Lachman, who is an associate professor at the RTA School of Media. Facebook\u2019s move to keep posts about the man-made virus also highlights, according to Lachman, the responsibility of its users to become more media literate. \u201cWhat it means for you and I as consumers of news \u2014 it\u2019s on us to get our news from more than one source, to do some investigation, and to be more sophisticated news consumers,\u201d said Lachman. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t But that\u2019s not the end of why the lab-leak theory is rearing its head again. An old correspondence sent to the U.S. president\u2019s chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci has recently resurfaced \u2014 sending the online community into a tizzy. Through a freedom of information request, several U.S. media outlets at the start of June obtained   from Fauci\u2019s account. Dr. Fauci on COVID lab leak theory: \u201cWe\u2019ve always said \u2018keep an open mind and continue to look.\u2019 So I think it\u2019s a bit of a distortion to say that we deliberately suppressed that.\u201d  \u2014 The Recount (@therecount)  One email, in particular, gained traction online. In January of 2020, a scientist in California wrote to Fauci that, upon examining the coronavirus\u2019 evolution, bats seem to serve as a \u201creservoir,\u201d but that a \u201csmall part\u201d of the virus genome has \u201cunusual features\u201d that \u201c(potentially) look engineered.\u201d ( , if you\u2019re curious.) Just this week, however,   to the New York Times, saying an engineered virus was a preliminary observation at the start of the pandemic, based on the limited data at the time.\u00a0 He has since rejected this theory. The World Health Organization and Biden certainly seem to think the lab-leak theory is worth examining, and so does  \u201cGiven the evidence we have now \u2014 or the lack of evidence we have now \u2014 you can\u2019t just dismiss either hypothesis,\u201d said Tiessen, director of the Master of Health Administration (Community Care) at Ryerson University. \u201cThere are reports, particularly with H1N1, that this has happened before.\u201d That was in 1977, when the influenza virus re-emerged after a 20-year absence. Many theorized that this meant it had leaked from a lab. A   produced evidence to back this theory. Another virus that   is SARS. \u201cPeople make mistakes, so this sort of thing can happen,\u201d said  , a political expert and the director of Master of History at Trent University. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t However, even if a COVID lab-leak is a possibility, Tiessen and Sheinin maintain it is very hard to believe that it would have been released on purpose. Therefore, Tiessen says the lab-leak hypothesis should not be labelled a \u201cconspiracy.\u201d \u00a0 If the investigation does produce answers, Tiessen doubts it would have \u201cabsolute proof.\u201d Health experts say the truth of where the novel coronavirus came from must come to light in order to learn about virus transmissibility, potential remedies, and for the sake of public transparency. Biden has given his investigation team only 90 days. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Joe Biden administration will get more information than the World Health Organization,\u201d said  , a medical doctor and political and health policy expert with Wilfrid Laurier University. \u201cI think the 90-day duration is strategically designed so that it\u2019s enough to put pressure, by other countries, on the Chinese government to be more forthcoming.\u201d Khalid also says the U.S. may use the investigation as leverage for future diplomatic relations with China. \u201cI do think the public absolutely has the right to that kind of knowledge \u2014 about how the COVID-19 virus started. Whether we get it is a different question.\u201d Sheinin says if the U.S. is able to discover the true origin of the pandemic, this would reestablish the U.S.\u2019s position as a global power. \u201cIf they can demonstrate that \u2014 yes \u2014 I think it would reassert a long-standing international preeminence for American science, and I think Biden is conscious of that,\u201d he said. However, Sheinin believes Biden ultimately launched the investigation for public good \u2014 not for political gain or to distinguish himself from his predecessor, Trump. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Either way, Sheinin says the relations between the U.S. and China \u201care pretty bad right now. I don\u2019t know if they could get much worse.\u201d If the virus were to be found to have come from a lab in China \u2014 even accidentally \u2014 Khalid says the U.S. and other countries can still hold them accountable. \u201cI think there would be massive repercussions diplomatically,\u201d said Khalid. \u201cSanctions are one way \u2026 whether we have the ability to enforce those sanctions on China would be a different thing.\u201d  does not think Biden\u2019s probe will lead to people hammering Canadians of Chinese origins with blame, despite no proof of a lab-leak yet. \u201cAny responsible government on Earth, anywhere, should have the responsibility to find the root cause of this pandemic that caused a lot of death,\u201d said Tse, chair of the board of directors for the Chinese Canadian National Council in London, Ont. \u201cThe finding may totally acquit China, and likewise, it can totally convict China \u2026 The majority of us in Canada are mature enough to understand where this disease came from, and how it happened. So if President Biden wants to find out, good for him.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think health reasons should be overshadowed by political views. We are talking about human lives,\u201d he added. In the end,\u00a0 whatever the investigation produces (if anything), Khalid says it should not turn the public\u2019s attention away from mitigating COVID-19\u2019s spread. \u201cNo matter what the origin of the COVID-19 virus is, the reality is, it\u2019s still an infectious disease.

Speaking at a press conference Thursday, Canada\u2019s chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam told reporters that the risk of future outbreaks in vaccinated and under-vaccinated populations was \u201ca reality going forward.\u201d She pointed to the Yukon as an example of a community having a highly vaccinated population that still saw an outbreak in its under-vaccinated younger population, which then spread to other populations such as young kids in daycares. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cSo one does have to still have some plans in place in terms of reducing risk in those settings in which children will congregate,\u201d she said. Tam said several measures, like better ventilation, were now being considered to help protect kids from infection, especially heading into the fall school semester. \u201cIt is a difficult space at the moment, but I think the objective is to keep children engaged in social and school settings for as much as possible.\u201d Keeping up high vaccination rates in the community as well as low transmission rates was also a key aspect in helping younger populations who have not received their vaccines yet, Tam said. Currently, COVID-19 vaccines have still not been approved by Health Canada for those under the age of 12. Both the Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines are approved for ages 18 and up, while the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been approved for those 12 and older. To date, at least 68 per cent of Canada\u2019s population has received one dose and 39.9 per cent have been fully vaccinated, after taking into account those under the age of 12. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t New Brunswick\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jennifer Russell said earlier this week that while there are less serious outcomes from contracting the disease for younger people, \u201cany unvaccinated part of our population is at a higher risk of contracting COVID.\u201d A Pfizer spokesperson said that they hope to submit potential approval for their vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 sometime in the September-October timeframe.

Suddenly I couldn\u2019t hold onto any thoughts,\u201d she said, adding \u201cI didn\u2019t know who I was, where I was. I don\u2019t know how long I was like that.\u201d At the time, she was 31 years old and showing the usual first signs of infection, dry cough and nausea. What ended up happening was far from typical. She started suffering from debilitating neurological symptoms that have now taken over her life. Her doctors don\u2019t know why. Taylor is a lawyer. Her ability to process information and remember details is critically important for her employment. \u201cIt feels like your brain is broken,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI forget things that I just did. I don\u2019t remember doing things. I forget words. I don\u2019t remember grammar all the time. It\u2019s been dubbed \u201cCOVID brain fog\u201d \u2014 a common term used to describe worrisome cognitive symptoms, signalling something might be going wrong inside the brain. These warning signs can include dizziness, memory loss, confusion and difficulty finding words. \u201cThe virus might impact the brain in certain people impairing their activities of daily living and potentially stopping them from being gainfully employed,\u201d said Simon Graham, a senior scientist at the Sunnybrook Research Institute in Toronto. \u201cSo, this is a health issue and a societal issue.\u201d It\u2019s a problem that is hitting patients of all ages, young and old \u2014 some with mild symptoms and others who didn\u2019t test positive at all. Now, doctors are struggling to treat these side effects and researchers are scrambling to figure out why it\u2019s happening. \u201cGiven the fact that there are so many people that are being infected by the virus, it winds up being a health issue that we need to deal with,\u201d Graham said, who has already set up a study looking at the short-term and long-term effects of COVID-19 on the brain. No one really knows how many people are suffering from coronavirus-induced brain injuries. But in November, researchers found nearly 10 to 35 per cent of COVID-19 survivors in the United States experienced similar disabling and persistent neurological symptoms. My short-term memory is nonexistent  said Tracey Thompson, 52, who has had brain fog since the spring. \u201cLike running a bath \u2014 it\u2019s a treacherous thing to do now because I have to sit there and watch it because I don\u2019t know, if I leave the room, if I am going to remember that that\u2019s what I was doing. Thompson is a chef in Toronto. Creating food is her passion. That\u2019s why changes to her ability to taste and smell are concerning and she worries about her future. \u201cI\u2019m eating food and from one bite to the next, it\u2019s (like) the sense has just turned off, right? They turned off like a light switch and there was nothing \u2014 like a complete absence. No salt, no sweet, no nothing, just texture,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, you are profoundly unwell.\u2019\u201d \u201cMore interestingly, though, I\u2019ve been having olfactory hallucinations where I smell things that aren\u2019t there. I\u2019ve smelled smoke, like thinking something is on fire.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The loss of smell and taste \u2014 known effects of COVID-19 \u2014 are considered to be neurological symptoms, but research into this area is in its infancy. Some evidence suggests the virus may be able to get into the brain through the nasal cavity and into the orbitofrontal cortex. \u201cInterestingly, the brain is covered with a membrane called the dura. And the orbitofrontal cortex actually doesn\u2019t have any dura. It\u2019s the only part of the brain that has this potential pathway. And so, the virus can get in there,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThe inability to smell is actually associated with other neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, Parkinson\u2019s Disease and multiple sclerosis,\u201d said Teresa Liu-Ambrose, director of the Aging, Mobility, and Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory at the University of British Columbia. At UBC, Liu-Ambrose and her colleagues are trying to figure out if the damage caused by the virus is prematurely aging the human brain. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cI think the best I understand the potential impact of COVID-19 on the brain, I would describe it almost as an accelerated aging process,\u201d said Liu-Ambrose, whose team is aiming to assess approximately 1,000 people, some with and without the virus. Liu-Ambrose\u2019s work is part of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging COVID-19 Brain Health. The project is funded in part by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Weston Brain Institute. Using neuroimaging, one aspect of the study will be looking for signs of silent strokes in the brain. Silent strokes or mini-strokes can happen without any obvious behavioural warning signals. So, a person can have one without ever knowing. \u201cWhen we age, one of the common things that happens within our brain is that the blood vessels do become compromised in part because of chronic conditions,\u201d Liu-Ambrose said. \u201cAnd when that occurs in normal aging, what happens within the brain is \u2026 silent strokes.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe also know that they collectively do contribute to our risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia.\u201d There is evidence to suggest COVID-19 impacts the same blood vessels that feed the brain. If the virus is damaging those vessels, which could speed up aging, this, in turn, means some survivors might be at risk of getting early-onset dementia. \u201cI worry that, you know, one day maybe I\u2019ll have a big stroke,\u201d said Taylor, who is on medical leave. \u201cI\u2019m still struggling a lot. And, you know, to be a lawyer means to use your brain. And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get to the point where I\u2019ll be the same.

She\u2019s struggling with her short-term memory and she has to set up numerous alarms to help her through her daily activities. \u201cI was extremely healthy before this. You know, I worked in a kitchen, I was a chef. I worked the line. I can rock-and-roll with the best of them,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIf this is a permanent state for me, I\u2019m going to have to figure out a new way to be in the world \u2026 My wall of Post-it notes can\u2019t travel with me.\u201d"},
{"title": "Breakthrough cases: What\u2019s it like catching COVID-19 after vaccination? - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted August 15, 2021 1:33 pm", "body": "Toronto resident Jana Singer started to develop a sore throat when she was on holiday in Mexico last month. Upon her return at the Toronto Pearson International Airport, Singer tested positive for   \u2013 almost two months after getting fully vaccinated with a first dose of Moderna followed by Pfizer. She suspects she got the disease walking around unmasked in Baja. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cI got the vaccine and then I went to a place that had very, very high COVID transmission. And I did nothing to protect myself,\u201d the 44-year-old Canadian told Global News.  \u2014 when you are infected at least two weeks after the final dose of a vaccine \u2014 have been reported in Canada and elsewhere. As of July 24, in Ontario alone, among the roughly 8.5 million fully vaccinated people,  . They showed symptoms after 14 or more days following the last dose. While the cases are rare and unsurprising, experts say continued surveillance amid the spread of the highly transmissible   is needed. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing unusual about the breakthrough case,\u201d said Dr. Donald Vinh, an infectious disease specialist and a medical microbiologist at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC). \u201cWhat the vaccine is primarily supposed to do is prevent you \u2026 from becoming sick once you become infected. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make you superman or superwoman.\u201d Vinh stressed that the small frequency of breakthrough infections still highlight the fact that vaccines are \u201cabsolutely important\u201d. Horacio Bach, an infectious diseases expert at the University of British Columbia (UBC), said while the vaccine doesn\u2019t make you completely immune to the virus, it still remains unclear what the long-term effects of infection might be. \u201cAnd more problematic is that once you are infected, even if you are vaccinated, you still can release the virus and transmit the virus to other people,\u201d he told Global News. But breakthrough cases among the vaccinated are less contagious compared to unvaccinated people who get the disease,  In the United States, among the   as of July 31, 2021 in Washington state, 88 per cent had symptoms, seven per cent were hospitalized and 66 people died of COVID-related illness. For Singer, her bout with COVID-19 was not a bad experience. She says it felt like a regular cold with no fever \u2014 and her symptoms resolved within two days. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cI was nervous at first because I lost my sense of smell and taste, which is very disturbing,\u201d she said. Bach\u2019s brother in Israel recently contracted the disease \u2014 nearly six months after getting two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. He developed strong sinusitis, fever and lost his sense of smell and taste as well. \u201cHe was in bed, basically with a very strong flu,\u201d according to Bach. Vinh said a general trend of COVID-19 among those fully vaccinated were mild symptoms, with a low-grade fever, sore throat and cough. \u201cWhat we\u2019re certainly not seeing are symptoms that are so severe that you require ICU,\u201d he added. Bach agreed, saying symptoms tend to be stronger if you are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. Data coming out of the United States suggests the same with the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) saying that symptoms and duration of illness in breakthrough cases have been attenuated compared with infections in unvaccinated people. Among hospitalized or fatal breakthrough cases as July 19, 2021, 74 per cent were aged 65 years or older,  . Meanwhile, immunocompromised people \u2014 such as those with an underlying condition like cancer \u2014 and transplant recipients are at a higher risk of breakthrough infections, Vinh said. This is because their body cannot respond to the vaccination the same way as healthy individuals. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThey are at risk of becoming quite sick despite being fully vaccinated because their immune system is weak,\u201d Vinh said. In fact in the U.S., 44 per cent of breakthrough infections were among people who were immunocompromised \u2014 prompting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to   of\u00a0COVID-19 vaccines\u00a0from\u00a0Pfizer\u00a0and\u00a0Moderna\u00a0for people with compromised immune systems.  by researchers at the University Health Network (UHN) on Aug.11\u00a0also pointed in favour of a third-dose vaccine booster for  . \u201cIn a transplant recipient, we often find the antibodies are undetectable after two doses of vaccine,\u201d said Dr. Deepali Kumar, study co-author and transplant infectious diseases physician. \u201cWhat we found in our study was that we had a number of people who were exactly like this \u2026 who then became positive after the third dose of vaccine so I think that gives a glimmer of hope to people that maybe they just need that one more shot to mount a positive antibody response,\u201d she told Global News. While the booster shots may benefit immunosuppressed patients and prevent breakthrough cases among them, Vinh says it\u2019s too early to roll out subsequent doses for the population at large. Breakthrough infections may even boost immunity, data suggests. A   last month revealed significantly higher antibody levels in fully vaccinated infected individuals compared to fully vaccinated uninfected individuals. As for Singer, she says she is happy she got vaccinated. \u201cDo I believe that that it (the vaccine) protected me? A 100 per cent.\u201d"},

New Brunswick is expected to enter Phase 2 on July 1. This phase includes opening up the province to others in Atlantic Canada, and to the rest of the country for people with one dose of the vaccine. The second phase will come into effect when 20 per cent of New Brunswickers 65 and older have received their second dose. As of Tuesday, 18 per cent of New Brunswickers 65 and older are fully vaccinated. \u201cIf we can keep doing what we are doing and get the second dose as soon as we can we will be fully green sooner than we have projected a few weeks before. Potentially weeks sooner,\u201d said Higgs. The third phase is expected to come into effect on New Brunswick Day, Aug. 2, as long as 75 per cent of New Brunswickers 12 and older have received their second dose of a vaccine. At this time the province will move to the Green level, the mandatory order will end and all restrictions will be lifted. Russell said she expects case numbers to increase as we open up to the rest of the country. In New Brunswick, the path toward the Green level of the COVID-19 recovery plan includes three phases to slowly loosen restrictions, with target dates based on anticipated vaccination rates and low numbers of COVID-19 hospitalizations. In terms of lifting restrictions, Phase 1 includes changes in travel, social gatherings, sports and sporting events and faith gatherings. All other restrictions will remain in place, including the requirement for travel registration and the use of masks, based on a health zone\u2019s alert level. New Brunswickers should check the rules in effect in other provinces prior to travel. There have been 45 deaths, and the number of active cases is 85. Eight patients in total are hospitalized. Seven patients are hospitalized in New Brunswick, including two in an intensive care unit. One patient is hospitalized out of province in an intensive care unit. On Monday, 1,118 tests were conducted for a total of 352,506."},

Researchers said fully vaccinated people were also 69 per cent less likely to be hospitalized and 49 per cent less likely to die from COVID-19 than those who were unvaccinated. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Dr. Steve Flindall, an emergency physician at the Mackenzie Health Hospital in York Region, echoed those statistics and said a majority of patients coming into his hospital with COVID-19 have yet to get their shots. \u201cThey may have had a previous COVID infection, but did not get the vaccination as has been recommended,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re seeing a lot of kids come in. They can\u2019t be vaccinated. They\u2019re often going to these summer camps that have been opened up and (are a) lot of times maskless on top of everything.\u201d The epidemiology report found that 84.9 per cent of Canadians hospitalized with COVID-19 were unvaccinated, while 82.3 per cent of people who died hadn\u2019t yet been jabbed. Flindall says he can \u201calmost understand\u201d vaccine hesitancy among people who have already contracted COVID-19 and lived \u2014 but says many of the reasons unvaccinated patients give when arriving at the hospital \u201cjust aren\u2019t logical.\u201d At this point, Flindall says the vaccine has established itself as safe and effective against COVID-19. \u201cPeople go on far less proven treatments for stuff like cancer because they want the best treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd COVID will kill you a lot quicker than cancer, let me tell you.\u201d Despite this, officials say the number of hospitalizations and deaths is decreasing across the country. During the week of July 11 and July 17, the number of people dying from COVID-19 in Canada dropped 20 per cent, for a total of nine deaths. The number of hospitalizations and cases in the intensive care unit also decreased by 15 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively, at 576 hospitalizations and 252 ICU admissions. \u00a0 Although cases are declining, COVID-19 variants represent 70 per cent of all reported cases. The highly transmissible Delta variant has become the world\u2019s most dominant strain of the virus since it was first discovered in India in December. It accounts for almost 40 per cent of all cases in Canada, the epidemiology report said. Over the weekend, Canada reported 228 cases of the virus and three deaths.

New modelling presented by PHAC on Friday suggests that if current transmission levels are maintained, the number of new daily cases could decline in the coming weeks. Progress hasn\u2019t been even across Canada, officials say, but overall, numbers give \u201creason for optimism\u201d said Dr. Theresa Tam, chief public health officer of Canada. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWith the level of vaccine coverage that we have achieved in Canada to date, we are much better protected going into the respiratory infection season, and today\u2019s modelling update shows that by maintaining basic and less restrictive measures such as masking and limiting close contact, we could reduce the impact of COVID-19 this winter,\u201d Tam said. For the first time since mid-July, the reproduction number of COVID-19 has dropped below one, she noted \u2013 meaning that the pandemic is no longer growing. However, if transmission increases by just 15 per cent in the next few months, there could be a considerable resurgence of the virus this winter, she warned. For this reason, officials urge Canadians to continue to follow public health advice ahead of the Thanksgiving long weekend. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Case counts across Canada, while they have levelled off, still remain high, officials said. Infection rates are \u201cexceedingly high\u201d in some areas, they added. \u201cWe are far from declaring the pandemic over,\u201d said Dr. Howard Njoo, deputy chief public health officer.

And as Health Canada examines an application from Pfizer-BioNTech for its COVID-19 vaccine to be used in children aged five to 11, Tam said that if approved, such a vaccine could make a considerable difference in Canada\u2019s fight against COVID-19.

Speaking during a news conference Wednesday, Premier Iain Rankin said the province continues to watch the situation closely. \u201cWe need to continue to follow these restrictions, so they will remain in place. And if we do that, then we\u2019ll be able to be in a better place come mid-June,\u201d he said. The province is reporting another two COVID-19 related deaths and 83 new cases on Wednesday. The people who died were a man in his 60s in the eastern health zone and a woman in her 60s in the central health zone. A total of 74 people in Nova Scotia have now died of COVID-19. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The province is also reporting 164 new recoveries, bringing the number of active cases in the province down to 1,262. The province\u2019s health labs completed 7,324 tests on Tuesday. There are now 101 people in hospital, including 20 in ICU. Nova Scotia Health president and CEO Brendan Carr said about three quarters of patients are hospitalized in the central zone, which has created \u201cquite a bit of pressure\u201d in that region. He said eight patients, both COVID and non-COVID, have been transferred to hospital in another health zone to relieve some of that pressure. \u201cThis is really so that we can continue to have some capacity to deal with what we know are going to be additional COVID patients in both acute care and ICU,\u201d he said. The 83 new cases include 59 in the central health zone, 19 in the eastern zone, three in the western zone and two in the northern zone. While much of the community spread so far has been in the central health zone, Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia\u2019s chief medical officer of health, said he was concerned by the number of cases in the eastern zone, where most of the new cases are concentrated in Sydney. \u201cWe are beginning to see community spread in Sydney,\u201d he said, adding that most of those cases are among people in their 20s and 30s. Starting Thursday, Strang said there will be a new pop-up COVID-19 testing centre at Centre 200. He said the primary assessment centre on Grand Lake Road continues to take both walk-in rapid testing and PCR testing by appointment, and the primary assessment centre at the Northside General also offers appointment PCR testing. Strang said testing has \u201cdropped off a little bit\u201d and encouraged everyone in the region to get tested. \u201cWe need to seek out and find all the COVID that\u2019s in this area,\u201d he said. Another patient in a non-COVID unit at the Halifax Infirmary site of the QEII Health Sciences Centre has tested positive for the virus and has been moved to a COVID-19 unit amid an outbreak at the hospital. A total of 15 other patients and six staff members have tested positive during the outbreak. Twelve of those patients remain in hospital. As well, two of the cases in the eastern zone involve a resident and outside agency staff member at Harbourstone Enhanced Care, a long-term care facility in Sydney. A third case involves a staff member of the My Cape Breton Home for Seniors in North Sydney. \u201cStaff and residents in the impacted units of both facilities are being tested and residents are being cared for in their rooms,\u201d a release from the province said Wednesday. \u201cMost residents of both facilities have received both doses of COVID-19 vaccine.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t A central zone case involves a staff member at the Ivy Meadows long-term care facility in Beaver Bank. It\u2019s the second case involving a staff member at this facility. Most residents there have also been given two doses of the vaccine. As of Tuesday, 442,535 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered, including 40,096 second doses. The province opened up Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to people 30 and older Monday morning, and Rankin has said the province expects to have all eligible groups open by next week.

They will get an automatic approval conditional upon providing proof of permanent residency to border officials. This proof includes government-issued identification cards, driver\u2019s licences, passports, and utility bills and bank statements showing their permanent home address. Rotational workers will have to do the full application process for their first trip back to the province since May 14. When they complete the application, they will be contacted looking for further documentation. After the first trip back, they will still need to apply for future trips, but will get their approval \u201cmuch faster,\u201d said Strang. The lockdown\u2019s extension means the province\u2019s students will continue remote learning for the rest of the school year. At Wednesday\u2019s briefing, the premier thanked teachers, students and families for their efforts. Nova Scotia Teachers Union (NSTU) President Paul Wozney echoed that sentiment, saying in a news release that he wanted to \u201cthank parents and guardians for their patience and cooperation as we\u2019ve transitioned to distance learning over the past three weeks.\u201d Wozney says the union supports the decision to extend remote learning for the remainder of the academic year and is hopeful September will be much better. \u201cThis was a difficult decision, which demonstrates a deep commitment on the part of Dr. Strang and Premier Rankin to the safety of students, teachers, school staff and families,\u201d Wozney said. \u201cThe NSTU looks forward to working with government in the best interests of students as we navigate through the rest of this school year and as we prepare for the next one. Hopefully by the time September arrives, it will be safe to resume some, if not all, normal activities.\u201d Strang also spoke about the upcoming May long weekend, which he said will look \u201cvery different\u201d from Victoria Day weekends past. \u201cThe variants make this a very different and difficult situation right now, so this long weekend cannot be the social occasion that we\u2019re used to,\u201d he said. People can\u2019t get together in groups, even outside. Strang said they can still see a close friend or neighbor outside, with distancing. People can still visit parks, trails or beaches, but people can only travel within their communities and need to stay within their households. \u201cBut if you can maintain consistent physical distancing, you can meet one or two of your friends,\u201d he said. Private campgrounds are only open for seasonal campers and no short-term camping is allowed. People who own cottages can travel there if they intend to stay there all season, said Stang. \u201cA one time trip is okay, but you have to pick \u2014 whether it\u2019s your home, your cabin or campsite \u2014 which one will be your single primary residence through the spring.\u201d Strang also took a moment to call out the \u201cprivilege\u201d of people who wish to travel back and forth to their cottages during this time. \u201cI think people should recognize that if they actually have a cottage or a second place to go, they are extremely privileged. There are many people that are struggling to maintain their home, losing their jobs right now,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not go back and forth. That\u2019s not much to ask when many people are struggling for a lot more. We have people struggling for their lives in hospital. So choose one place and stay there.\u201d"},

Premier Jason Kenney announced the three-stage plan last week, which boldly aims to lift nearly all COVID-19 public health restrictions province-wide by the end of June or early July. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The threshold for Stage 1 is that two weeks have passed since 50 per cent of eligible Albertans age 12 and older have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and that hospitalizations from the disease are below 800 and declining. There are currently 439 people in hospital with COVID-19 and Alberta hit the 50 per cent vaccination threshold on May 18. So what can Albertans do now, that they couldn\u2019t a day earlier? Here\u2019s a closer look at Stage 1 of the province\u2019s plan: Places of worship were given a head start to Step 1, with capacity restrictions easing last Friday. Effective May 28, places of worship were able to up their capacity to 15 per cent of their fire code. Albertans can now gather in groups of up to 10 people outdoors. Previously, the limit was five people for outdoor gatherings in much of the province. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Outdoor physical, performance and recreation activities are allowed in groups of up to 10 people. Participants must follow physical distancing rules. Activities are allowed for people of all ages. Personal and wellness services such as hair salons, nail studios and barbershops can reopen by appointment only. Walk-ins are not permitted. These services have been closed down for a little over three weeks. Funeral services can now have up to 20 people, not including facility staff, funeral clergy or organizers who are not considered guests. Funeral receptions remain prohibited under Stage 1. Wedding ceremonies are limited to 10 people, including the officiant, the couple tying the knot and witnesses. Wedding receptions remain prohibited. Patios at restaurants across the province are allowed to reopen. Tables are limited to a maximum of four people who must be from the same household or two close contacts for those who live alone. Indoor dining at restaurants remains closed. Retail capacity in stores across the province has been increased to 15 per cent of fire code occupancy. Physical distancing must be followed. Physical distancing and masks remain mandatory under Stage 1. The threshold for Stage 2 of the \u201cOpen for Summer\u201d plan is two weeks after 60 per cent of the eligible population receives one dose of vaccine and hospitalizations are at 500 and declining. The province  . Some of the changes in Stage 2 include an increase in the number of people who can gather outdoors, the reopening of indoor fitness activities with some public health restrictions still in place and the reopening of indoor entertainment venues like arenas, casinos, cinemas, museums and libraries. Stage 2 will also see increase capacity for wedding and funeral services \u2014 both indoors and outdoors \u2014 as well as the ability to hold funeral and wedding receptions outside.

Health Canada has approved the Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and   for use in Canada. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t At this point, it isn\u2019t clear whether a choice of vaccines will be available to Albertans. \u201cNo decision has been made regarding whether Albertans will have a choice in the future on which vaccine they get,\u201d reads a statement to Global News from Alberta Health. \u201cAll vaccines go through a rigorous review process to ensure they are safe and effective before being made available to Canadians. We continue to assess the data and evidence and will update Albertans as soon as any decisions are made.\u201d The province  , in accordance with a recommendation from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization not to give it to those over 65. But it said those in that age group may wait until May, when Phase 2D officially starts, to receive the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said Thursday that all approved vaccines are safe, effective and will reduce the risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19. However, that isn\u2019t stopping Albertans, such as Wayne Tabb, from being hopeful about getting to choose a vaccine. Tabb, 45, said the past year has been challenging and stressful. He accepts that his age places him lower down in the priority list. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be anytime soon. It is what it is,\u201d he said. But by the time his age group gets called, Tabb hopes there is a choice made available to him. \u201cJust being able to choose what I put into my own body is nice,\u201d he said. Tabb points to factors such as the different types of vaccines available and the number of doses required for those approved. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cBeing able to choose which one you get, I think, is fair,\u201d he said, pointing to the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, which is a single dose. \u201cIt would just be nice to have your voice heard and, yeah, maybe we could get our choice, right?\u201d David Evans, a professor in the University of Alberta\u2019s Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, said allowing people to choose their vaccine could \u201ctremendously complicate\u201d the delivery of vaccines. \u201cParticularly with the vaccines that require special freezing and refrigeration \u2013 if they don\u2019t get used up\u2026 it runs the risk of wasting vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cThe faster we can get widespread use of any vaccine, the faster the virus that is circulating in the community will be driven down. Waiting until you see the vaccine you want is not going to help that.\u201d The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have efficacy rates of more than 90 per cent; the AstraZeneca vaccine has an efficacy rate of 62 per cent. Despite a lower efficacy rate, there were no hospitalizations or deaths from COVID-19 in the trials with the AstraZeneca vaccine.  found the shot to be 66 per cent effective at mitigating moderate to severe illness and 85 per cent effective at preventing the most serious outcomes. Notably, there were no deaths among participants who had received the J&J vaccine and no hospital admissions after 28 days post-vaccine. Evans said any vaccine is better than nothing and Albertans should take whatever vaccine is offered to them. \u201cVaccines won\u2019t necessarily protect you from getting the disease, but if you do get it, they will protect you from the more severe consequences of that disease,\u201d he said. \u201cLess of those people who have been vaccinated are going to the hospital, and even less of them are getting so sick as to die.\u201d Biomedical ethicist Jonathan Kimmelman from McGill University said it is important for Canadians to remember all vaccines approved in Canada are safe to deploy. \u201cI think it\u2019s tempting to try and measure that lower efficacy one against the 90 per cent protection, but really what members of the public should be bearing in mind is zero per cent protection, which is going unvaccinated,\u201d he said. \u201cEven 60 per cent (efficacy) is a pretty good vaccine and in the midst of a pandemic, for (a) disease that is life-threatening, I don\u2019t think people should hesitate to get the vaccine if it has a lower level \u2014 an incrementally lower level \u2014 of efficacy.\u201d Public health ethicist Nicholas King, who is a professor in the biomedical ethics unit at McGill University\u2019s Department of Epidemiology, said there is evidence that vaccinating as many people as quickly as possible, regardless of which vaccine is used, will help flatten the curve. However, he notes there are other considerations. \u201cThere are questions regarding freedom of choice, but also really important questions around fairness and equity in the distribution of the vaccine,\u201d King said. He said there are concerns a two-tiered system could emerge where some populations have access to vaccines considered more effective while other populations have access to vaccines considered less effective. \u201cThis raises a real concern that some people might be systematically given better or worse vaccines,\u201d King said. \u201cFrom my understanding of the evidence, they are all effective and they are all good vaccines, but in terms of public perceptions, perceptions of fairness are really important to the success of a public health intervention.\u201d King said perceptions some vaccines may not be as good as others could contribute to people being hesitant to receive a vaccine, which could increase vaccine hesitancy overall. He recommends health authorities be transparent and open about which vaccines are administered and to whom. As for Kimmelman, he cautions Canadians who may want to pick one vaccine over another \u201cNumber one, we still don\u2019t know a lot about a lot of aspects about these vaccines so I\u2019m not even sure how well people can make informed choices,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a government standpoint, the key imperative right now is to stem this pandemic, to get it under control. \u201cA 70 per cent effective vaccine, even if it has no other advantages over 90 per cent, it\u2019s going to be enough to be able to open up our economy.\u201d Kimmelman\u00a0argues that there are monetary implications of administering a vaccine program that gives people choices, saying every dollar deployed to facilitate those choices may be one dollar less for getting vaccines into arms. \u201cTo me, that personal choice really has much less importance than public health objectives,\u201d he said. \u2013"},

Health Minister Christian Dub\u00e9 announced the initiative Friday at Loto-Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s headquarters in Montreal as the province ramps up its immunization campaign ahead of fall. \u201cI want to say this: it\u2019s not only to reward those who are already vaccinated, but also those who will get vaccinated,\u201d he told reporters gathered at the state-owned gaming commission. Registration for the contest will begin online starting July 25, he said. The goal is to encourage eligible Quebecers who haven\u2019t done so already to book their appointments as soon as possible. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Four draws will take place throughout the month of August every Friday for adults who have received their first dose. Each draw is $150,000 for a total of $600,000. There is a grand prize of $1 million in September for those 18 and older who have received both shots of the vaccine. Quebec is also opening the lottery to children aged 12 to 17, but will give winners in that age category bursaries ranging from $10,000 to $20,000 for school. Qu\u00e9bec introducing a contest to reward people for being vaccinated. A prize of $150k will be given away every Friday in Aug to someone with at least 1 dose. $1 mil given out on Sep 3 to someone with 2 doses. Kids under 18 can win school grants.  \u2014 Dan Spector (@danspector)  Quebec is the latest province to adopt a lottery system to bump up numbers. Alberta and Manitoba have used prizes to incentivize vaccination. Finance Minister Eric Girard described it as a new initiative to help the province, which has been hard hit by the pandemic, to reach its vaccination goals. To qualify for the grand prize, entrants will need to have both doses of their vaccine by Aug. 31, which means they\u2019ll need to get their first dose by July 31 at the latest, he added. \u201cIt\u2019s another tool,\u201d he said. The lottery system comes as the government aims to have at least 75 per cent of every eligible age cohort fully vaccinated by the end of August. In Quebec, adults between the ages of 18 to 29 continue to lag behind older citizens, with about 69 per cent of that age cohort vaccinated with at least one dose. About 73 per cent of children between 12 and 17 are vaccinated with one dose. \u201cEach percentage point is worth 75,000 new people being vaccinated, so is it worth it? I think every penny is worth it at this stage of the game to ensure we are ready for Sept. 1,\u201d Dub\u00e9 said. The government has boosted vaccination efforts in recent weeks. As of Thursday, the interval between doses has been halved from eight weeks to four for children aged 12 to 17. All eligible Quebecers are now able to bump their booster shot. Last week, the province also announced the introduction of a novel coronavirus vaccination passport system for September. Under the plan, the passports will only be used if there is a spike in COVID-19 cases or an outbreak. In that case, people will have to prove they are adequately vaccinated to access certain non-essential services such as gyms, bars and restaurants. The goal is to prevent a fresh wave of lockdown measures when students return to class and cold weather sets in. Dub\u00e9 stressed again that vaccination is key to returning to some kind of normalcy in the coming months. That is why the province is putting in so much effort to get shots into arms before autumn. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this to avoid hospitalizations if cases creep up in the fall,\u201d he said."},

The province has been in Stage 2 of its relaunch since June 12 but has seen an uptick in confirmed   cases this month. \u201cHealth is about more than the avoidance of COVID-19,\u201d Hinshaw said, explaining that when virtually the entire economy was shut down in the spring, there were detrimental impacts on people\u2019s mental health, much of that brought on by unemployment. \u201cWe need to be able to balance these things. \u201cI believe that we can move forward successfully.\u201d She said that while there are already rules and guidelines in place for non-essential businesses to operate amid the ongoing pandemic, her team is also currently \u201cworking on a more assertive approach to reminding businesses of the need to follow that guidance.\u201d Hinshaw said her team and the government continue to analyze various metrics including cases requiring hospitalization and hospital capacity when determining when it\u2019s safe to move forward with Alberta\u2019s relaunch.

University of Saskatchewan epidemiologist Nazeem Muhajarine told Global News on Friday that the possibility of new or existing variants of COVID-19 spreading throughout Canada could lead to a possible resurgence in new cases. As an example, Muhajarine pointed to the small East African island nation of Seychelles which had at least 60 per cent of its population fully vaccinated with either the Sinopharm or AstraZeneca vaccines. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t With the majority of that country\u2019s population having already had two shots, the island nation decided to open its borders to tourism \u2014 an industry it heavily relied on.

Muhajarine\u2019s warning comes as Canada itself just reached its milestone of 50 per cent of the population receiving at least one shot of the vaccine, while only about four per cent of the population has received two doses. The B.1.1.7 variant, which first originated in the U.K., has, for the most part, become the dominant variant of the virus in Canada. Shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have proven to be effective against that variant, according to a  , while Moderna itself   that its shot appeared to be effective against the U.K. and B.1.351 variant first found in South Africa. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Cases of the B.1.351 and the B.1.617 variant first found in India are still continuing to spread in Canada, albeit slowly. Despite that, Muhajarine renewed calls for the federal and provincial governments to get as many people fully vaccinated as possible, and to double down on infectious disease monitoring and rapid testing. That warning also comes just ahead of the long holiday weekend, which experts say will most likely contribute to another spike in new cases down the road. Concerns over increased social gatherings during the Victoria Day weekend have led several public health officials and frontline workers to brace for a surge in cases. Epidemiologists have cited an increase in new cases just about six to 10 days following almost all social events. Dr. Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba, said that while he expects the surge in new cases from this weekend to be subdued due to several factors, including the country\u2019s vaccine rollout, there still is uncertainty in predicting whether or not another wave of the virus could come in the future. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to say \u2026 What I can say is the virus continues to be unpredictable \u2014 we don\u2019t have a blueprint for COVID-19,\u201d said Kindrachuk, who pointed to the worldwide inexperience in dealing with the novel coronavirus. He said that it would also be difficult to draw from our experiences dealing with previous flu or coronavirus outbreaks as well, simply because the population hasn\u2019t \u201cbeen in this situation before\u201d with COVID-19. While he agreed that there was a potential for yet another wave, Kindrachuk noted that the possibility or severity of one hinges on several factors \u2014 like whether or not we could see new variants come into play or if vaccines continued to provide protection against such variants. \u2014\u00a0"},
{"title": "Trudeau doubles down on mandatory COVID-19 vaccines for domestic travel - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted August 18, 2021 3:00 pm", "body": "Mandatory   vaccination policies for some sectors and public spaces are quickly emerging as one of the key proposals being put to Canadian voters during the first week of the  Liberal Leader  , who is running for re-election as prime minister, doubled down on Wednesday over questions about his plan to require proof of vaccination for all those looking to travel domestically as soon as this fall, amid a fourth wave primarily driven by unvaccinated people. Trudeau was asked on the campaign trail specifically whether people without a medical reason for not getting vaccinated will still be allowed to board a plane or train with accommodations. He said no. \u201cCanadians know that the way to get through this pandemic is for everyone to get vaccinated. So unless people have a medical exception, they will not be able to board a plane or a train in Canada if they are unvaccinated,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cThat is about protecting our young people. It\u2019s about protecting Canadians. We are absolutely unequivocal on that because this is how we get through this pandemic.\u201d Two days before asking the governor general to dissolve Parliament and call an election, Trudeau\u2019s government unveiled new policies that require vaccination for domestic travellers, require federal workers to be vaccinated, and that set the expectation for federally regulated industries to do the same. While Trudeau has said there will be \u201cconsequences\u201d for federal workers who refuse to get vaccinated without a medical reason, he has not said whether he thinks they should be disciplined or fired. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh pushed for as much earlier in the week, saying that collective bargaining agreements between the government and unions include options for discipline and termination. He defended that stance on Wednesday after one of the major public sector unions pushed back. \u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t get vaccinated and they need to get vaccinated \u2014 it\u2019s mandatory \u2014 then they\u2019re not able to be in that position,\u201d Singh said. \u201cSo that would be one of the potential consequences.\u201d In a statement issued Tuesday night, the Public Service Alliance of Canada said while it supports requiring vaccination, it doesn\u2019t believe that should be enforced through discipline. \u201cPSAC supports vaccination requirements for federal workers to ensure the safety of our members in their workplaces, and to protect our communities, but using discipline and termination to enforce them is unacceptable,\u201d said the union, which represents roughly 200,000 public service workers. \u201cIf there are workers who are unable or unwilling to be vaccinated, the government must temporarily reassign those employees to other duties where possible or allow for alternate work arrangements such as remote work,\u201d the union continued. \u201cWhere required, other measures should be explored, including regular screening and rapid testing.\u201d Conservative Leader Erin O\u2019Toole has argued against mandatory vaccine requirements, suggesting rapid testing and masking are \u201creasonable\u201d alternatives. The highly contagious Delta variant now accounts for the majority of cases infecting Canadians. Several provinces have paused reopening plans as the virus continues to spread rapidly among unvaccinated Canadians and raises concerns about the impact on those such as young children who are not yet eligible for any of the approved vaccines. In the U.S., hospitals in some states  . Dr. Kieran Moore, Ontario\u2019s chief medical officer of health, warned of a \u201cdifficult fall and winter\u201d ahead because of the Delta variant and the spread among unvaccinated Canadians. Breakthrough cases can happen in fully vaccinated people but are rare, and the vaccines are incredibly effective at preventing severe outcomes like hospitalization and death. As of Aug. 13,   71 per cent of the total Canadian population has at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while 62 per cent of the total population is fully vaccinated."},
{"title": "Is it time to ditch disinfecting? CDC updates data surrounding COVID-19 surface transmission  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted April 18, 2021 10:23 pm", "body": "If you look back at the past year, how much of your time has been dedicated to disinfecting alone? Minutes? Hours? Days? Well some recent CDC data seems to suggest the tedious chore is no longer worthy of your time. , your chances of contracting COVID-19 from a surface (called fomite transmission) in an indoor community are low \u2014 less than 1 in 10,000.  says it\u2019s important to acknowledge that the data has some limitations. The brief says fomite transmission depends on several different variables, including how much virus is on the surface, how long it has been sitting there, whether or not it\u2019s been exposed to a cleaning agent, heat, or ventilation. It\u2019s also difficult to prove that fomite transmission has occurred, according to the CDC, because respiratory transmission cannot be ruled out. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that they would actually come out and say that transmission from fomite is relatively low risk,\u201d said Blondeau. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The brief also breaks down how long COVID-19 particles can survive on a surface. On a porous surface, COVID-19 particles can be detected for minutes or hours. On a non-porous surface such as stainless steel, glass, or plastic, the virus can be detected for days or weeks. However, the brief highlights that within three days, 99 per cent of infectious particles on the surface break down under regular indoor conditions, even if the surface hasn\u2019t been cleaned, though the CDC says these studies do not necessarily reflect real-world conditions. But even if the contact happens, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get sick, says Pantophlet. For that, your soiled hands would have to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. This is why   emphasizes that frequent handwashing should remain part of our routine, even if chances of the virus being on a surface are low. \u201cAlthough the virus can sit on a door handle, it tends not to live very long,\u201d said Smith?, a professor in the School of Epidemiology and Public Health at the University of Ottawa. \u201cThe simple answer is viruses need moist environments, and your hands are moist environments.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The CDC guidelines say cleaning a high-touch surface with detergent or soap once a day is enough, if there hasn\u2019t been a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case in the area within 24 hours. If there has, you\u2019d need to clean with a disinfectant. So, should we just cut down on the daily overzealous disinfecting? Blondeau says this may be too risky. \u201cEven if it\u2019s a low risk of transmission from a fomite, it\u2019s not zero,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a point in time right now where we still have a very vulnerable part of our population, and we have variants of concern that are spreading across the country\u2026 my own personal opinion would be is that this is not the time to relax some of these recommendations.\u201d Meanwhile, Pantophlet says it would be helpful to wait and hear from Health Canada about this.   still recommend individuals to \u201cfrequently clean\u201d high-touch surfaces in their homes or public spaces. In the meantime, Pantophlet says individuals can assess the present risk in a given situation before deciding to disinfect. Has the surface you\u2019re about to touch been cleaned recently? Do the people in this enclosed space frequently wear masks, or are they spewing their droplets everywhere? \u201cIt\u2019s not a \u2018one size fits all,'\u201d he said. Smith? says washing or disinfecting 20 times may have never been great in the first place, since it exhausts the energy we need to keep up with other important measures, such as physical distancing. That\u2019s why she says it\u2019s best to focus on mitigating our risk based on the modes of transmission that are most proven \u2014 direct contact, respiratory droplets, and airborne transmission. This means focusing our energy on staying home, not coming into close contact with those outside our household, and avoiding indoor gatherings. Smith? also stresses that the CDC\u2019s new disinfecting guidelines can be applied to areas like a small office space or a home. However, high-traffic environments such as a hospital need to continue to disinfect frequently, since the potential of an infectious particle to be present on a surface is multiplied."},

During an unrelated news conference Monday morning, Ford was asked what will come after the province spends at least three weeks in Step 3. \u201cWe\u2019ll be working with the health team. We\u2019ll be rolling that out shortly over the next three weeks. We want to get to Step 3. I know everyone is quite happy in Step 2,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to work day in and day out (to) number one get every single business open in this province, get them back on their feet, but we\u2019re going to do it cautiously too. So\u2026 we\u2019re going to take the directions from the health team and work with them.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t It was on June 30 when Ontario moved into Step 2 of the plan, which expanded outdoor activities and settings as well as began the opening up of indoor settings. Among the highlights of Step 2 were the reopening of personal care services such as hair and nail salons. Also indoor gatherings of up to five people were given the OK to go ahead. Under the plan released on May 20, a minimum period of three weeks will be in place before Step 3 could come into effect. Based on the published criteria, the earliest Ontario could enter Step 3 would be July 21. During his first news conference since assuming the position of Ontario\u2019s chief medical officer of health, Dr. Kieran Moore said he expects the province will remain in Step 2 for at least three weeks due to concerns about COVID-19 variants. \u201cWith Delta being present, we obviously have to watch what is going on around the world where Australia and multiple cities have had to lockdown, Israel is back with masking in public spaces, Europe might be looking at further public health measures,\u201d he said, noting the two-to-three-week intervals are important. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be watching internationally, nationally, provincially, locally \u2014 being data-driven and advise government based on data.\u201d In terms of the vaccination guidelines set out for Step 3 (between 70 and 80 per cent of eligible adults receiving their first vaccine dose and 25 per cent receiving their second dose), those thresholds have since been met. Moore was pressed about possibly accelerating the move into Step 3. However, he reiterated past government messaging and said reduced hospitalizations, ICUs as well as the level of virus spread and its associated reproduction rate will all be weighed in the decision to leave Step 2 behind (the exact thresholds for each of those data metrics weren\u2019t released). He also emphasized that at least two weeks is needed for the most recent individuals who received their second vaccine dose in order for them to see their immunity build up. There have been lingering questions about what will come during and after Step 3 over the past several weeks since the three-phase plan does not return Ontario to pre-pandemic opening and service levels. In the Step 3 guidelines, there are general statements that speak to a variety of sectors but unlike Steps 1 and 2, there aren\u2019t specifics in certain areas. For instance, when it comes to gatherings, the current roadmap to reopening states \u201clarger indoor and outdoor gatherings with size limits.\u201d Similar wording is in place for indoor religious ceremonies and rites. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Looking ahead after Step 3, it\u2019s not clear if, like the first three steps, further phases will be tied to COVID-19 vaccination rates. Also, a number of sectors and industries can operate in Step 3 but with restrictions. It\u2019s not yet known when those restrictions will further be eased or removed. Here\u2019s a high-level look at what\u2019s changing in Step 3: \u2013 Large indoor, outdoor gatherings allowed and indoor dining reopening \u2013 Greater expansion of capacity for retail businesses \u2013 Larger indoor religious services, rites and ceremonies allowed \u2013 Indoor meeting, event spaces reopening \u2013 Indoor sports, recreational facilities reopening \u2013 Indoor seated events, attractions, cultural amenities reopening \u2013 Casinos and bingo halls reopening \u2013 Other outdoor, Step 2 activities will be allowed to operate indoors Here's the chart that outlines what's allowed to operate at each phase.  \u2014 Nick Westoll (@NWestoll) "},

On Saturday, Jujamcyn Theatres, the company behind a Broadway production featuring   reversed course, saying audience members who received the AstraZeneca shot would be welcome in its audience. The theatre had previously said those who wanted to see \u2018Springsteen on Broadway\u2019 would need proof of vaccination by a shot approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The shot from AstaZeneca has not yet received the green-light from the agency. It has, however, been approved for use in Canada, and more than 2.92 million doses have been delivered to the provinces and territories. Kerry Bowman, a professor of bioethics and global health at the University of Toronto, said the \u2018Springsteen on Broadway\u2019 incident is a \u201cclassic example\u201d of what vaccine passports do. \u201cThey\u2019re divisive, they\u2019re bureaucratic, and they\u2019re often not evidence based,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you ask yourself from a scientific point of view, are people vaccinated with AstraZeneca a higher risk than the other people within that audience? Absolutely not.\u201d Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Trudeau said the federal government is working on \u201ctwo tracks\u201d in terms of proof of vaccinations for Canadians who want to travel. The initial phase, he said, will use the  , an app that allows travellers to digitally provide contact and quarantine information. \u201c(The) initial phase will be to have people upload image of proof of vaccination so border agents can verify on their return to Canada,\u201d Trudeau said. The prime minister said more details will be made available in the coming weeks. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t According to Trudeau, the feds are also working with provinces to \u201cestablish a national certification of vaccination standard,\u201d which could be ready in the fall. It\u2019s not clear, however, what proof of vaccination Canada will accept from those seeking entry into the country. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, Canada\u2019s Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the federal government is \u201cworking with allies, obviously, in the European Union, the United States and others to find the most appropriate way to recognize proof of vaccination for citizens who want to travel internationally.\u201d Bowman said developing vaccine passports where some vaccines are accepted and others aren\u2019t could potentially \u201cexacerbate already very difficult geopolitical tensions.\u201d He pointed to the COVID-19 vaccines being distributed in China and Russia, adding that if they are not accepted globally, that could cause significant global issues. \u201cAnd, you know, we have enough trouble geopolitically as it is with both the Russian Federation and China,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to create any more tension.\u201d Bowman also said the idea of vaccine passports could \u201cput people into a panic about what kind of vaccine they\u2019re going to get\u201d and encourage \u201cvaccine shopping.\u201d It could also create inequality issues, he explained. Bowman said what could be perceived is that lower income countries will be sent \u201cb-list or non-preferred vaccines,\u201d like AstraZeneca. \u201cSo (they would be) acceptable for low-income countries (but) not acceptable for wealthy countries like Canada,\u201d he said. \u201cetc etc\u2026\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a very negative and destructive message.\u201d Ultimately, what Canada should do, Bowman said, is \u201cfollow the science.\u201d \u201cWhat we need to define is: What are the acceptable thresholds of any vaccine? Does the person have it or do they not,\u201d he said, as opposed to only accepting the vaccines that are approved in Canada. Bowman added, though, that there has been a lack of \u201cclear global leadership\u201d when it comes to vaccine passports. \u201cThere\u2019s no country that\u2019s really stepped up globally to try and coordinate things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe WHO\u2019s done I suppose what they can, but they\u2019re fairly overwhelmed on this front, (and) we don\u2019t have clear guidance.\u201d For now, the federal government is continuing to urge Canadians not to travel unless absolutely necessary. What\u2019s more, on Friday, Canada\u2019s public safety minister announced the Canada-U.S. border would remain closed to all non-essential travellers until July 21. \u201cOur number one priority as we fight #COVID19 is keeping Canadians safe,\u201d Blair wrote in a tweet. As we have said, the government is planning measures for fully vaccinated Canadians, Permanent Residents, and others who are currently permitted to enter Canada and will provide further details on Monday, June 21. \u2014 Bill Blair (@BillBlair)  \u201cAs we have said, the government is planning measures for fully vaccinated Canadians, Permanent Residents and for others who are currently permitted to enter Canada and will provide further details on Monday, June 21,\u201d he tweeted. Bowman said when the border re-opens, U.S. officials could allow Canadian travellers into the country, but only those who have received a vaccine other than AstraZeneca. \u201cI do not believe they\u2019ll do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know that either.\u201d  the agency was \u201ctaking a very close look\u201d at the possibility of vaccine passports as the coronavirus pandemic eases and Americans begin to travel overseas. Mayorkas added, though, that a guiding principle during the pandemic has been \u201cmaking sure that any passport that we provide for vaccinations is accessible to all and that no one is disenfranchised.\u201d"},

The province reported more than 2,000 daily cases for three consecutive days last week, reaching the highest single-day total since the start of the pandemic on Saturday, at 2,433, with a positivity rate of 12 per cent. Over the past week, the daily positivity rate has been near or above 10 per cent in Alberta. As of May 3, there were 658 people in hospital in Alberta as a result of COVID-19, with 154 of those individuals in intensive care. Ontario, with roughly three times the population of Alberta, was the only province with more people in hospital due to the virus (1,925) than Alberta, while both Ontario (889) and British Columbia (176) had more individuals in ICU. \u201cWe have the worst performance right now of every province and state in the United States and Canada,\u201d Alberta\u2019s former chief medical officer of health Dr. James Talbot said. \u201cWe\u2019re often comparable to B.C., but right now we have 300 per cent of the cases per day that B.C. is getting. \u201cB.C., Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec have all managed to take the third wave and start to bring the number of cases down, which means they\u2019ll be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Talbot said. As of May 2, B.C. had 9,425 active cases and the rate of COVID-19 was 78 per 100,000 population over the previous seven days. There were 83,280   in Canada and 22,920 of those were in Alberta, which represented   of all active cases in the country as of May 2. Ontario was the only province with more active cases (37,200). Over a   ending on May 2, the rate of COVID-19 in Alberta was 296 per 100,000 population, which was the highest in the country. The U.S. state that comes closest to Alberta\u2019s COVID-19 case count in the same time frame is Michigan with 252 cases per 100,000 people over the seven days. Ontario had the second-highest rate in Canada at 170 per 100,000 population, while the national average was 141 per 100,000. In April, the province moved back to Step 1 of its COVID-19 plan, and last week, Kenney announced targeted measures for \u201chot spots,\u201d including that junior and senior high school students would be returning to online learning for at least two weeks. Following Saturday\u2019s record high of COVID-19 cases, the premier announced Monday the province would announce   Tuesday, although he did not provide details. \u201cI said last Thursday that if Albertans aren\u2019t willing to do what\u2019s right, even though it\u2019s hard, then we will be forced to take further steps,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cGiven the issues we\u2019ve seen this weekend and the record high cases reported, we are developing a package of stronger public health measures, which I expect to announce tomorrow.\u201d Talbot said the measures implemented by the province prior to Tuesday were not enough, particularly with variants of concern, which now make up 63.8 per cent of active cases in the province, becoming the dominant strain of the coronavirus. \u201cWe said when the new variant appeared in the province \u2014 because it was more transmissible \u2014 if the province continued to relax, as they were proposing to do, that we would see the new variant take off, that eventually it would become dominant and we would get a third wave,\u201d Talbot said. \u201cWe are well into a third wave and we\u2019re not bringing it under control like other Canadian provinces are and the measures from three weeks ago are clearly not working.\u201d Talbot said Kenney needs to institute a lockdown to get the situation under control. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of things that we could do but we need to stop with these half measures and go to something that actually brings us under control,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that the decision was made to put the   into lockdown so that MLAs could be protected but the government doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to protect the rest of Albertans. \u201cIf you can\u2019t wait for government \u2014 and you shouldn\u2019t \u2014 then go into voluntary lockdown,\u201d Talbot said. \u201cThat means you can stay in your home, you can stay in your home with people who have been with you through that time period.\u201d Calgary emergency room physician Dr. Joe Vipond said the province needs to close non-essential stores, limit essential retail stores to 50 per cent capacity, close all schools across Alberta to in-person learning and have all Albertans who are able move to working from home. \u201cThis is a big bad situation and these variants are really hard to deal with because they are so transmittable and they do cause more severe disease, so unless we do take radical action, we will be overwhelmed,\u201d Vipond said. On Monday, Alberta\u2019s NDP called on the government to implement four measures including increasing fines significantly for those violating COVID-19 public health orders, developing a guideline on enforcement and streamlining court processes. \u201cIt is clear that we are failing to enforce the current public health measures,\u201d NDP leader Rachel Notley said. \u201cThe largest fine we can see levied against someone violating the public health orders to date was $1,500 handed out to the pastor at GraceLife Church. \u201cThe largest ticket we have seen issued for a single violation is $1,200. I do not believe this is enough of a deterrent.\u201d The NDP wants current fines for individuals to increase to $3,600 and to create a fine for those who obstruct the enforcement of public health orders, such as harassing frontline workers when they are enforcing orders. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s been reported that many of these tickets are being dropped when challenged in court. Clearly, there is a problem,\u201d Notley said. \u201cHe (Kenney) is always happy to talk the the talk. Today, I call on him to walk the walk.\u201d The official Opposition also wants a new guideline from the solicitor general to police to \u201cconsistently and vigorously enforce the terms of the Public Health Act,\u201d and transition all fines under the Public Health Act to the new administrative penalty process introduced in Bill 21. Kenney said he has asked Justice Minister Kaycee Madu to look at the NDP\u2019s recommendations and take them into consideration. Also Monday, Kenney announced teachers, childcare workers and support staff will be able to book vaccine appointments. Three weeks ago, Kenney resisted calls from the\u00a0Alberta Teachers\u2019 Association to give front-line staffers vaccine priority, saying the government will follow priorities tied to scientific evidence rather than \u201carbitrary pressure.\u201d Nevermind a lockdown, there are those Albertans who are opposed to any restrictions and have been vocal with their views with protests, rallies and blatantly disobeying the restrictions.  west of Edmonton failed to comply with province\u2019s measures throughout the pandemic before a fence went up around the church on April 7 at the direction of AHS. On Saturday, a rodeo near the community of Bowden drew hundreds of people. The event was called the No More Lockdown Rodeo Rally. Alberta Health Services sent a letter to organizers indicating the event would be illegal, but organizers proceeded with the rodeo. Kenney released a statement on social media Sunday, stating his concerns: \u201cIt is disturbing to see large numbers of people gathering this weekend at Bowden in flagrant violation of COVID-19 public health measures,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe are all sick of this. We all want it to end. Thousands of Albertans are following the rules, sacrificing travel and social gatherings to do their part to stop the spread of COVID-19. \u201cNot only are gatherings like this a threat to public health, (but they are also) a slap in the face to everybody who is observing the rules to keep themselves and their fellow Albertans safe.\u201d Talbot said he is saddened to see events such as this weekend\u2019s rodeo take place. \u201cI don\u2019t know what other signal people want to see to suggest that they really need to pay attention to protecting themselves and the people they care about,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way things are going, we are going to continue to go up.\u201d Kenney has argued the primary issue with Alberta\u2019s fight against the virus has been some Albertans refusing to follow the rules. \u201cFor whatever reason, too many Albertans are ignoring the rules we currently have in place,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me emphasize that Alberta has essentially the same rules as our neighouring provinces of British Columbia and Saskatchewan. Their case counts are going down while ours are going up \u2014 this is incredibly frustrating for all of us.\u201d University of Alberta sociology professor Dr. Amy Kaler believes people who are already not following the rules will not change until there are consequences. \u201cWe\u2019re still hearing that people need to take individual responsibility, make good choices, smarten up and so forth, despite more than a year\u2019s worth of evidence that, that is not going to get us out of this,\u201d Kaler said. Last week, Global News learned AHS was meeting with certain staff\u00a0to discuss what to do and how to approach life-or-death decisions if  \u00a0patients overwhelm the system. The invitation, which was shared with Global News, described the Alberta Critical Care Triage Framework as protocol to be used if \u201ca dire situation\u201d were to occur where \u201cthe demand for life-sustaining critical care support is greater than the available resources.\u201d The framework includes specific protocols for both adults and children. \u201cAny health care provider who has to make a decision based on this protocol is going to be making the worst decisions of their life, the ones that they are going to regret the most,\u201d Talbot said. \u201cIt\u2019s insanity that a triage protocol that was developed for use during war would be used during peace time for something that we could prevent.\u201d On Tuesday night,\u00a0 \u00a0as a way to prepare the health-care system to ensure it can meet demand.

In the last five days, an average of more than 23 people have been admitted to Alberta\u2019s ICUs each day. \u201cIt\u2019s tragic that we are only able to keep pace with some of these sort of numbers because, in part, some of our ICU patients have passed away. \u201cAnd this reality has a deep and lasting impact on our ICU teams,\u201d she said. Yiu said the ICU admission numbers are highs the province hasn\u2019t seen in the three previous waves of COVID-19, nor in Alberta\u2019s history. She said every day, the province reaches a new high. Alberta reported 1,660 new COVID-19 infections Thursday, bringing the total number of active cases to 20,180. Labs completed nearly 18,000 tests, putting the province\u2019s positivity rate at 9.4 per cent. Officials said 1,058 people were in hospital as of Thursday, with 226 being treated for COVID-19 in ICUs. An additional 17 deaths linked to the virus were also reported. \u201cAlbertans who have not been vaccinated are about 15 times more likely than those with vaccine protection to end up in the hospital from COVID-19,\u201d Hinshaw stressed. \u201cThey are about 40 times more likely to be admitted to the ICU. About 77 per cent of Albertans in hospital with COVID-19 are not fully vaccinated and 92 per cent of those in the ICU right now have not had both shots.\u201d Hinshaw dismissed misinformation online about the effectiveness of vaccines against the newest dominant strain of the virus. \u201cWe have heard persistent questions and rumours on social media that vaccines are not working against the Delta variant, but this is categorically untrue. \u201cIn Alberta, COVID vaccines have proven to be 85 per cent effective against infection with the delta variant with two doses,\u201d she said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t On Thursday morning, federal Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Bill Blair tweeted a response to the  , should it be needed. \u201cTo the people of Alberta, I recognize the significant, immediate challenges currently facing Albertans, and know the importance of ensuring support to your health-care system,\u201d he wrote in a formal letter of response. \u201cAs such, I am pleased to officially confirm that the government of Canada will support the provincial government\u2019s recent request and provide the necessary support to Albertans during this difficult time.\u201d Our Liberal government will always be there to support Canadians in their time of need.  Please see my statement on the difficult situation in Alberta:  \u2014 Bill Blair (@BillBlair)  Hinshaw also addressed questions about whether having previously contracted and recovered from COVID-19 negates the need to get immunized. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cAt this time, everyone needs proof of vaccine or a recent negative result on a privately purchased test or a medical exemption in order to enter businesses in the Restrictions Exemption Program,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cThe bottom line is that my advice for those who have had COVID-19 remains the same: it is still best for everyone to be fully vaccinated with two doses to obtain the greatest possible protection against infection.\u201d She said there is still some risk that anyone, whether they\u2019ve recovered from COVID-19 or have been partially or fully immunized, could be re-infected with COVID-19, and go on to transmit the virus to others who are vulnerable to infection. Alberta Health confirmed an additional 17 deaths had been reported over the last 24 hours. \u201cEvery day we see the numbers. There are people behind the numbers,\u201d Yiu said. \u201cThey are spouses and partners, grandparents, uncles and aunts, sons and daughters. They are people\u2019s best friends and loved ones.\u201d Six of the new deaths were reported in the Edmonton zone. A man in his 40s, a woman in her 90s, two women in their 80s and a man in his 60s, all with pre-existing conditions, died. A woman in her 30s with no know conditions also died. Three deaths were reported in the Calgary zone, all with pre-existing conditions: a woman in her 80s, a man in his 70s and a man in his 90s died. The Central zone also reported three deaths, all with pre-existing conditions. In that zone, a woman in her 60s, a woman in her 70s and a woman in her 80s died. There were four deaths reported in the North zone where a woman in her 80s, a man in his 90s and two men in their 70s died. All four had pre-existing conditions. The final death was reported in the South zone. A man in his 70s with pre-existing conditions died. Hinshaw explained the province has made a change to the daily checklist for those with COVID-19 symptoms, and is now recommending when someone tests positive for the virus, any unvaccinated or partially vaccinated person in the household should quarantine for 14 days. While it\u2019s not legally required at this time, she said officials are \u201cstrongly recommending\u201d Albertans do so. \u201cThis is because living in the same home as someone with COVID puts you at the highest risk of becoming infected and further spreading the virus to others,\u201d Hinshaw said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Hinshaw said she recognizes the change will have a significant impact on those with family members in school or daycares, and while it may be inconvenient, it\u2019s a change officials believe will slow the spread of the virus. The new checklist item only applies to household contacts, not workplace or classroom contacts. Alberta\u2019s Opposition leader says it\u2019s time Premier Jason Kenney hand over public health decisions related to the COVID-19 crisis to medical professionals. Rachel Notley says it\u2019s become clear Kenney is more focused on his political survival than on the pandemic that has overrun hospitals. The NDP leader says sound public health decisions are being undermined by political compromises. She is urging public health decisions be turned over to Dr. Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer of health, backed by an independent scientific panel of advisers. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Kenney is facing criticism from some of his legislature members over his handling of the pandemic. Some United Conservative constituency associations are pushing for an immediate review of his leadership. Kenney met with his caucus this week and has asked to move a review up to next spring instead of late 2022."},
{"title": "Why women are bearing the brunt of COVID-19 vaccine side effects - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted April 21, 2021 7:56 am", "body": "Since countries have started rolling out  , more women than men have reported side effects, such as   and allergic reactions, and according to experts, this is not surprising. If anything, it shows the shot is working. Whether mild or severe,  , has shown that women are bearing the brunt of vaccine reactions, and experts believe it may be due to estrogen. Because the side effects (although extremely rare) can be life-threatening, Hoption Cann added that it is still a concern. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t On April 13, Canada announced its first report of a rare blood clot in a Quebec woman who had received the AstraZeneca   vaccine. On the same day, U.S. health regulators recommended pausing the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine   experienced a rare blood clot. During the first month of vaccine administration in the U.S., 61 per cent of the doses were given to women, but  , according to the U.S.   (CDC). Despite these reports, Health Canada has not drawn a link between gender, age and the coronavirus vaccine. On Friday, Canada\u2019s deputy chief public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo said Health Canada is looking \u201cvery carefully\u201d at the data that has been provided in terms of women and vaccine side effects. \u201cBased on a fact that such it\u2019s a small number, if you\u2019re looking at stratification by age and gender there\u2019s not enough evidence to indicate this specific group is at higher risk. I think it\u2019s still an evolving situation and will continue to look at the data,\u201d he said. One of the reasons for increased vaccine side effects in women could be behavioural, Linda Dresser, an infectious diseases expert and assistant professor at the University of Toronto, explained. Women are more likely than men to report health problems to their doctors, she said. Another reason is the biology of a woman\u2019s body, as estrogen produces a stronger immune reaction against the shot. \u201cBiological females have a different immune response than males; we produce more antibodies in response to vaccines or infections, and sometimes it can be twice as many antibodies to a vaccine\u2026compared to biological males,\u201d Dresser said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The side effects are usually higher in women of child-bearing age because that\u2019s when they produce the most estrogen, she explained. And estrogen is able to stimulate an immune response by binding to immune cells and producing antibodies. She said\u00a0 , women of reproductive age\u00a0were four times more likely to have adverse reactions to the shot, even though more men received the vaccine,  . Conversely, really high levels of testosterone can be immunosuppressive. That may be why fewer men report side effects, she said. \u201cEstrogen doesn\u2019t just cause you to cause antibody responses to vaccines, but it\u2019s why women tend to have a higher incidence of autoimmune disorders, so things like lupus, rheumatic arthritis or things that are autoimmune where your body\u2019s kind of fighting against itself. So I think there\u2019s a real biological plausibility to what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Dresser said. What are some of the side effects reported by women? As vaccines are rolled out, doctors are seeing more and more\u00a0swollen lymph nodes in recently immunized people,  . As a normal side effect to most vaccines, the axillary lymph nodes in the armpit area on the side where vaccination took place can temporarily swell up or become enlarged \u2014 a sign that the vaccine is working by mounting an immune response. This is called unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy (UAL). Although this reaction is common, it is causing some concerns for women who may mistake it as a sign of breast cancer. For women, the side effect of an enlarged lymph node near the breast may resemble a sign of breast cancer. \u201cThe rate of enlargement is more common compared with the other vaccinations,\u201d Dr. Sandeep Ghai, division head of breast imaging at the University Health Network, Sinai Health and Women\u2019s College Hospital,  \u201cNaturally there is panic and fear among women.\u201d Enlarged lymph nodes when seen on a mammogram are also a sign of leukemia and lymphoma. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The lymph nodes become tender and swell up within two to four days after the COVID-19 vaccination, and the swelling can last up to six to eight weeks. Some women can feel the lump, but for others, the swelling is only detected during a mammogram exam, which involves an X-ray image of the breasts. To avoid confusion, the Canadian Society of Breast Imaging and Canadian Association of Radiologists\u00a0 , where possible, to consider scheduling screening exams prior to the first dose or six weeks after either dose in average-risk patients. Some women are reporting heavier or irregular menstrual cycles after getting their shot. A colleague told me she has heard from others that their periods were heavy post-vax. I'm curious whether other menstruators have noticed changes too? I'm a week and a half out from dose 1 of Moderna, got my period maybe a day or so early, and am gushing like I'm in my 20s again. \u2014 Dr. Kate Clancy \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@KateClancy)  Although there haven\u2019t been any studies to confirm this link, this reaction can again be due to estrogen, Dresser said. \u201cIt\u2019s all driven by estrogen responses and hormonal responses,\u201d she said, adding that this side effect may have not been seen in clinical trials as a requirement for women who partake in them is that they\u2019re not going to be getting pregnant, meaning they could be on some form of birth control. \u201cAnd birth control pill regulates your menstrual cycle. So you\u2019re not going to see that kind of signal in that kind of controlled environment,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut take it out of that controlled environment into the real world, you are going to maybe see that your period has gone haywire for a month after you got the vaccine.\u201d There is one scientific study looking into this link happening in the United States by two researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Washington University. The researchers are looking for participants in a study on the impact of the COVID vaccine on the menstrual cycle. According to\u00a0 , women who participate in the study will take a survey that asks about the timing of their vaccines, menstrual cycles and menstrual period. With both the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, there are reports that involve extremely rare clotting, including a type of\u00a0blood\u00a0clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), which was seen in combination with low levels of\u00a0blood\u00a0platelets, called thrombocytopenia. With the AstraZeneca vaccine, so far, most of the cases reported have occurred in women under 60 years of age within two weeks of vaccination,\u00a0 . Among possible causes being investigated are that the vaccine triggers an unusual antibody in rare cases. So far, risk factors like age or gender have not been singled out. \u201cEven if you haven\u2019t got a vaccine, women get more blood clots than men,\u201d Dresser said. \u201cWe get more blood clots when we take birth control because you\u2019re adding in more reproductive hormones, and more blood clots while you\u2019re pregnant, again because your body is producing more hormones.\u201d Kelly Grindrod, a pharmacist and professor at the University of Waterloo\u2019s School of Pharmacy, said although women are reporting more blood clots it may be too early to link gender to the vaccine. She said while some side effects, like fatigue and a sore arm, are typically felt in women more than men, \u201cthe blood clot one is a little bit different. We don\u2019t actually know that gender is a risk factor for that blood clot issue.\u201d \u201cWhat we do know is that in the places where the blood clots happened the most and the earliest, so in Europe, they were vaccinating health care workers with AstraZeneca and health care workers tend to be women,\u201d she explained. It\u2019s not that the vaccine necessarily caused more blood clots in women, she said, but it could be that more women were getting inoculated. \u201cSo the jury\u2019s still out a little bit on whether it\u2019s the fact that women were getting the vaccine, or if in fact, this is more common in women,\u201d she said. Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) is a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect that has also occurred   after receiving a coronavirus vaccine.  looking at vaccine adverse events reported to the CDC from 1990 to 2016 found that 80 per cent of severe allergic reactions involving adults came from women."},
{"title": "COVID-19 deaths of fully, partially vaccinated Albertans is the minority: doctors  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted June 4, 2021 6:37 pm", "body": "Alberta Health is reporting that 88 per cent of   \u2013 or 628 people \u2013 in the province since the start of 2021 to June 3 have been in Albertans who were unvaccinated or within 14 days of their first dose. Meaning that 12 per cent of COVID-19 deaths \u2013 or 85 people \u2013 from January 1 to June 3 have been in Albertans who were partially or fully vaccinated. \u201cIt is a higher number than a lot of us expected,\u201d said Dr. Tehseen Ladha, a physician with a Master of Public Health as well as an assistant professor in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Alberta. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t But Ladha said there could be several reasons for this data point, including that clinical trials, which showed high efficacy in preventing hospitalization and deaths, don\u2019t necessarily reflect the real-world experience. \u201cWhen these vaccines were trialed, they\u2019re trialed in a large number of people but not millions and millions of people. \u201cOnce you start to vaccinate millions of people, you tend to see the real world efficacy of the vaccine, which tells us how effective it is in real life against serious illness, hospitalization and death,\u201d she said. Ladha said new variants also play a role, adding that the vaccines may not be as effective against some of the variants that have emerged. Dr. Noel Gibney, a critical care physician and co-chair of the Edmonton Zone Medical Staff Association Pandemic Response Committee, said it may also boil down to the individual. \u201cI think it probably relates to individuals and their immune response so it\u2019s possible they\u2019re simply not able to mount a full immune response,\u201d he said. Of the 85 deaths in those who were partially or fully vaccinated, Alberta Health said 59 of them were in Albertans who were more than 14 days past their first dose; 26 were fully immunized. Gibney said the numbers show why a full vaccination series is critical. \u201cIt brings the point very clearly why we need two shots and why it\u2019s important everybody should be fully vaccinated,\u201d he said. Gibney further points to the B.1.617 variant, also now known as the Delta variant, to emphasize why two doses are important. According to\u00a0  one dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine was 33 per cent effective against the Delta variant. After two doses, that effectiveness increased to 88 per cent and 60 per cent, respectively. However, doctors stress that the deaths in those vaccinated are the minority of deaths in the province. \u201cThat really shows us vaccines do work. The group that was experienced the worst outcome, which is death, is those people who weren\u2019t vaccinated or didn\u2019t have acquired immunity yet,\u201d Ladha said. Alberta Health said that no vaccine provides 100 per cent protection but they had significantly reduced the severe effects of COVID-19 for Albertans. \u201cEven with the remarkably effective COVID-19 vaccines, a small percentage of people who are partially or fully vaccinated will still get COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus and this can lead to severe outcomes, including death,\u201d said spokesperson Tom McMillan. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t McMillan also said that the number of deaths is a \u201cmuch smaller\u2019 sample size than that for cases and hospitalizations and thus has the highest variability. He said that the vast majority of vaccinations have occurred in the last six weeks and it\u2019s likely that the figure will evolve in the coming weeks. With that said, Ladha said vaccines are not the sole ticket of this pandemic. The   that will see it move into Stage 2 on June 10. Stage 3 will trigger two weeks after 70 per cent of those eligible have received at least one dose of vaccine. \u201cThey\u2019re certainly one of the key pillars in the exit strategy for the pandemic but they need to be combined with public health restrictions in order to get community transmission low,\u201d she said, pointing to masking and restrictions on gathering limits. Ladha said there\u2019s a chance this summer will allow Albertans more of a sense of normalcy. \u201cBut the worry is, by doing this too quickly, we\u2019ll incite a fourth wave despite having vaccines at hand,\u201d she said. Gibney is also concerned that the province\u2019s reopening plan, which is based on first doses, moves too quickly and should only move further into reopening when the majority of population has received two doses. On Thursday, chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said second doses were embedded in calculations for reopening. \u201cWe estimated that our second dose coverage would be relatively stable and increasing over time\u2026 We wanted to make sure as we were communicating to Albertans, we were using very understandable metrics and again wanted to use that leading edge metric of those first dose coverage pieces knowing that the second dose would be coming along behind,\u201d she said."},
{"title": "Canada hits COVID-19 vaccine milestone as 75% receive one dose, 20% fully vaccinated - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted June 19, 2021 11:49 am", "body": "Over 75 per cent of eligible Canadians over 12 years old have now received at least one jab of an approved   vaccine while more than 20 per cent have been fully vaccinated. According to   the country hit its 75 per cent partially vaccinated threshold Friday evening with 25,029,378 Canadians receiving one dose of vaccine. Hours later, on Saturday afternoon, the country had administered enough doses for 20 per cent of the eligible population to have received both shots. To date, a total of 31,735,308 doses of COVID-19 vaccines having been administered across the country. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The achievement lands Canada squarely on the first goal laid out by the Public Health Agency of Canada in early May. At the time, federal health officials released what they described as a \u201croadmap\u201d to earn more normalcy in the spring, summer and fall. They said if Canada reaches 75 per cent single-dose coverage and 20 per cent full or second-dose coverage \u2014 including those 12 years old and above \u2014 provinces could safely begin easing restrictions on public movement without overwhelming hospitals and ICUs again. Canada\u2019s chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, had said back then that if vaccinations go according to plan and if 75 per cent of Canadians are fully vaccinated, people could \u201clook forward to moving indoors together.\u201d PHAC officials had said Canadians could even have the chance to get back to college classrooms, play indoor sports and hold family gatherings. However, speaking at a COVID-19 press conference last week on June 15, Tam said the variants used to develop those earlier models didn\u2019t include the Delta variant, which is the most infectious one tracked in Canada to date and is believed to cause more severe illness. It is expected to become the dominant variant circling the country. \u201cIf we model the Delta variant now and put that into that model \u2026 it does mean that even higher vaccination coverage would be even better at protection against the hospitalizations and overwhelming the health system,\u201d said Tam. Tam said that knowing one dose is proving to be less effective against the Delta variant, but that two doses are doing very well, it is more important than ever to aim for full vaccination as quickly as possible. \u201cShould we aim for higher?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes, I think we should. As I said, shoot for higher, shoot for gold, shoot for the stars. That gives us a better buffer for managing the COVID-19 situation.\u201d The Delta COVID-19 variant, also known as B.1.617.2, was first identified in India last fall but was only designated a variant of concern by the   in mid-May. On June 18, the health body cautioned against the B.1.617.2 becoming the globally dominant variant of the disease. Britain has reported a steep rise in infections with the\u00a0Delta\u00a0variant, while Germany\u2019s top public health official predicted it would rapidly become the dominant variant there despite rising vaccination rates. The Kremlin blamed a surge in COVID-19 cases on reluctance to have vaccinations and \u201cnihilism\u201d after record new infections in Moscow, mostly with the new\u00a0Delta\u00a0variant, fanned fears of a third wave. New cases in Namibia, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Rwanda have doubled in the last week, WHO emergencies program head Mike Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s a trajectory that is very, very concerning,\u201d Ryan said. The variant has already made its way to 10 provinces and one territory in the country and has been listed as a variant of concern by Health Canada. According to a recent study from Scotland, the Delta variant of the coronavirus may double the risk of hospitalization among COVID-19 patients when compared with the Alpha variant first discovered in the U.K. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Researchers looked at 19,543 COVID-19 cases and 377 hospitalizations among 5.4 million people, including 7,723 cases and 134 hospitalizations in patients with the Delta variant, who tended to be younger and more affluent. The risk particularly increased in those with five or more medical conditions known to contribute to more severe disease, the researchers reported June 14 in  They found that two doses of the vaccines from Pfizer, BioNTech or AstraZeneca still provide strong protection, although not as strong as the protection provided against the Alpha variant. Two weeks after the second dose, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was found to provide 79 per cent protection against infection from the Delta variant, compared to 92 per cent against the Alpha variant. With AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine, there was 60 per cent protection against Delta compared with 73 per cent for Alpha. According to infectious disease physician Dr. Isaac Bogoch, the country\u2019s reopening plan needs to be approached very carefully. \u201cWe have to protect those who are not vaccinated until everyone has an opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to really focus on second doses and really ensure that we have a smart prioritization of second doses such that we can really protect people who are either more vulnerable to this infection or communities that are disproportionately impacted by this infection,\u201d he added. Dr. Eric Arts, a professor at Western University\u2019s Department of Microbiology and Immunology, reiterated Bogoch\u2019s comments. Any vaccinated Canadian who becomes infected with the Delta variant, he said, is unlikely to need hospitalization or develop severe symptoms of COVID-19. However, he added, \u201cthat\u2019s still not completely clear.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThe fact that you could get this variant circulating in those who are immunized puts those who haven\u2019t been immunized at incredible risk,\u201d he said. According to Arts, vulnerable Canadians with already weakened immune systems could see severe symptoms so it might\u00a0be wise for the Canadian government to consider making necessary changes to its vaccine rollout. \u201cIf, for example, we try to finish immunization of the 12 to 18-year-olds before we go back to over 80-year-olds for a second immunization, we could be playing with fire,\u201d he said."},

The achievement comes as the country leads the world in the share of national populations vaccinated against the novel coronavirus, with close to 65 per cent of Canadians now having received at least one dose. Monday\u2019s 945 new infections marked the first time daily cases were under 1,000 since Sept. 20 of last year. Updated data from the weekend also showed cases remained low on Saturday and Sunday, with provinces and territories reporting 1,384 and 1,238 new cases, respectively. The seven-day average for new cases now sits at 1,305, according to a Global News analysis of nationwide data \u2014 the lowest average since Sept. 27, 2020. Cases have continued to steadily drop from the peak of the third wave in April, when over 8,700 new infections were being reported daily on average. Although slightly fewer tests are being performed daily in many provinces and territories compared to the spring, a Global News analysis found daily testing rates are comparable to those seen in the early winter \u2014 suggesting fewer tests are being returned positive. That\u2019s also been true week-to-week between May and June, according to Canada\u2019s chief medical health officer. In   Dr. Theresa Tam said 2.8 per cent of all tests performed between May 30 and June 5 were positive, compared to 3.8 per cent of roughly the same number of tests completed the week prior. Tam said the latest data prior to the weekend shows a 21-per cent decline in both hospitalizations and intensive care patients over the past week, along with a seven per cent drop in the average number of deaths reported daily. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Just over 1,300 Canadians are in hospital with COVID-19 symptoms as of Monday, which saw 13 more deaths reported across the country. The plummeting numbers come as Canada\u2019s vaccination rate remains on an upswing. More than 400,000 doses are being administered daily, according to the   \u2014 a rate of 1.11 doses for every 100 Canadians. The share of Canada\u2019s population with at least one dose in their arms is higher than any other country, according to Our World in Data. That\u2019s despite only 12.9 per cent of the population having received both required doses, which pales in comparison to many other countries including the United States, China and much of Europe. In her statement, Tam urged Canadians to get that second dose when eligible, reminding that two doses offers better protection against more transmissible variants of the coronavirus like the fast-spreading Delta variant \u201cand may make immunity last longer.\u201d \u201cHowever, regardless of our vaccination status while COVID-19 is still circulating, it is important to remain vigilant, continue following local public health advice, and consistently maintain individual practices that keep us and our families safer,\u201d she added. Many provinces reported daily case numbers not seen since last fall, as officials continued to weigh further steps in their reopening plans. Ontario \u2014 which reported 447 new infections and four more deaths \u2014 said Monday it will accelerate return-to-play plans for professional and amateur sports leagues, with games to return by August. The province also said it will reopen its borders with Quebec and Manitoba on Wednesday. Quebec on Monday lowered its pandemic alert for many regions, including Montreal and Quebec City, allowing limited indoor gatherings to resume and crowd limits to increase at funerals, weddings and religious services. Another 123 new cases and one more death were also reported. Atlantic Canada saw a combined 13 new cases \u2014 eight in Nova Scotia, four in Newfoundland and Labrador, and one in New Brunswick \u2014 while Nova Scotia announced its 90th death since the pandemic began. The region is awaiting vaccination targets to be reached in New Brunswick, where travel restrictions will be lifted for other Atlantic provinces once 75 per cent of residents have received at least one dose. As of Monday, the province is 1,345 people short of that goal. Manitoba reported 124 new cases and two more deaths Monday, but the strain on the province\u2019s health-care system remains high. Although the number of hospitalizations has dropped below 200 for the first time since mid-May, officials say they are still waiting for capacity to ease before lifting any more restrictions. Saskatchewan, which reported 55 new cases and one more death, is also just shy of its vaccination benchmark of 70 per cent. The government says more restrictions will be lifted three weeks after that goal is met. In Alberta, Premier Jason Kenney announced a $1-million lottery to encourage more people in that province to get vaccinated. He said 48,000 more doses need to be administered before nearly all health rules can be lifted following a two-week waiting period. The province reported 115 new cases and one more death on Monday. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Health restrictions will be eased on indoor gatherings, group activities and travel within British Columbia on Tuesday as COVID-19 immunization rates rise and case counts decline, Premier John Horgan said Monday.

Tam said that current evidence pointed at a \u201cbetter immune response\u201d when a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine was followed by either Pfizer or Moderna. \u201cI wish to emphasize that people who received two doses of AstraZeneca/COVISHIELD vaccine should rest assured that the vaccine they received provides good protection against infection, and very good protection against severe disease and hospitalization.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The new guidance also recommended that mRNA vaccines should be offered to start a vaccine series, unless contraindicated, as well as changes to interchangeability between those shots. Earlier this month, NACI said the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna could be mixed and matched safely, though Tam on Thursday appeared to have announced a reversal to that guidance. According to her, the advisory committee now recommends that anyone who received an mRNA vaccine as their first dose should opt for the same as their second. However, Tam said that if the same mRNA vaccine wasn\u2019t available for the second dose, another one could be considered and \u201cshould be offered\u201d to complete the series. The NACI\u2019s updates Thursday afternoon come just hours after the Ontario and Quebec provincial governments announced what looks to be contradicting guidance on second doses and vaccine interchangeability. The Ontario provincial government in a press conference earlier did not raise any issues regarding whether mRNA vaccines could be mixed and matched. \u201cWe will continue to communicate the strong message that the clinical table, that the advice from NACI, that Health Canada has said which is messenger-RNA\u2019s are completely interchangeable,\u201d said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones.

Instead, spread will likely occur in a more localized manner among the unvaccinated. \u201cNon-vaccinated people occur in clumps,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not randomly, evenly distributed among the population. It\u2019s a church group. It\u2019s an ethnic group. It\u2019s people in an apartment building. \u201cThat is something COVID can and will take advantage of.\u201d If spread gets out of hand, Furness thinks restrictions can be more targeted amid a possible fourth wave, such as closing a factory or church to prevent transmissions and severe illness. \u201cAny restrictions we may need are bound to be more selective, less blunt,\u201d he said. That being said, Furness pointed out that COVID-19 spread among the unvaccinated isn\u2019t an isolated problem, but does affect everyone \u2014 even the vaccinated. For one, cases could pack up ICUs again and delay non-urgent medical surgeries. That\u2019s not to mention the potential for more virus transmissions to create a new variant that is more resistant to our current vaccines, he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cUnvaccinated people are everybody\u2019s problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of easily avoidable illness and death.\u201d Thankfully, some fourth waves that are already occurring across the world have involved less deaths than in previous waves due to a high number of vaccinations, according to University of Toronto biomedical engineer professor Dr. Omar Khan. \u201cThat\u2019s a really good indication that yes, the vaccines are working,\u201d he said. Khan said Canadians should be paying attention to COVID-19 cases around the world as it can end up affecting us here. That\u2019s because a high number of cases can lead, again, to more variants. With border restrictions loosening but vaccinations still low in many countries, there is still the chance of a more resistant variant being imported into Canada, as has happened in the past. \u201cWe\u2019re at the mercy of what\u2019s happening globally,\u201d Khan said. \u201cMore effort has to be done to kind of try and bring this back globally so we can have stability here.\u201d He also pointed out that the unvaccinated are not only those who have willingly decided to not get the jab, but also children under 12 years old. They could potentially bring home the virus to their family, which can then be transmitted to another family, according to Khan, as vaccines don\u2019t 100 per cent prevent transmission but rather severe illness from the virus. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t If that spread happens, then some restrictions in schools, such as masks and social distancing, might have to be reinforced, he said, depending on the mode of transmission. Khan mentioned that vaccine manufacturers are working on getting approval to administer their products on children under 12 and are currently collecting clinical data. In terms of how many vaccinations may be necessary to completely stop a fourth wave, Khan said it is difficult to pinpoint given the possibility of new variants, which drive up the number of jabs needed. \u201cIf you give people a metric, and then you get a new variant that kind of changes everything, then you don\u2019t want to be judging by an obsolete metric,\u201d he said. \u201cThings really changed with the delta variant.\u201d For now, Khan is just happy our current vaccines are holding up. \u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate that the current vaccines are working for all the variants,\u201d he said. \u201cSo as long as we keep that bit of luck, we\u2019re good.\u201d"},

She has remained asymptomatic. \u201cYou may think of yourself as living in a separate household, but if you\u2019re sharing air, if you have someone living in the basement or you have somebody living above you, there is the risk of transmission,\u201d said Infectious Disease Epidemiologist Ashleigh Tuite. \u201cIf you are infected with COVID, even if somebody isn\u2019t in your traditional definition of your household, if you\u2019re sharing space and if you\u2019re sharing air, you should be considering those people as your contacts and advise them of the fact that you\u2019re infected,\u201d she added. Experts say keeping windows open could be key to minimizing the risk of transmission. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t As a teacher, Galbraith was aware of the benefits of masking and keeping the door and windows open in the classroom, but it had not occurred to her that precautions were needed in her home. \u201cWhat ends up happening is that if you\u2019re in a home and let\u2019s say the air conditioning is on, say all the windows are closed, the fresh air delivery or the amount of dilution that\u2019s going on is limited,\u201d explained ventilation expert Duncan Phillips of engineering firm Rowan Williams Davies and Irwin. \u201cAnd these droplets, when it\u2019s a drop, when you sneeze and it falls to the surface, it\u2019s gone. But when it\u2019s a small, fine droplet and it evaporates a little bit, it becomes an aerosol and starts to float around. The only way to get rid of that is dilution.\u201d Phillips noted heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems and their filters are designed to reduce airborne pollutants. \u201cYou stick in this filter that\u2019s got the MERV (minimum efficiency reporting value) 13 category and it basically knocks out 50 percent of any of those aerosol particles we\u2019re worried about he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Galbraith\u2019s son has recovered, but she wanted to share their story as Ontario gets set to enter Step 3, which will allow for indoor dining and movie theatres to reopen. She also pointed out, her son\u2019s symptoms were similar to those of seasonal allergies or a cold, and she had no symptoms at all, so had the family not been tested, the virus could have spread further. \u201cIt would have been really easy to ignore the symptoms we had and to go and have dinner in a restaurant where who knows what the ventilation is like, now that I know how easily it can spread just through ventilation,\u201d she said. Tuite noted this is a good example of why it is always best to get tested, even if you\u2019ve been vaccinated. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that we need to be mindful of as we move into this era where we have a lot of people who are fully vaccinated, which is not to be dismissive of symptoms that you do have because they could be COVID and so if you have the symptoms \u2026 if you have any reason to think that you might be infected, you should get tested.\u201d"},

But now the West Kootenay community that is home to about 4,000 people \u2013 is also a B.C.   hot spot. \u201cIt concerns me a lot,\u201d said resident and market vendor Tara Werner. \u201cWe\u2019re not immune to it.\u201d Data from the BC Centre for Disease Control shows that from June 4 to 10, Grand Forks had the highest transmission rate in the province by local health area, with an average of 13 new cases daily for every 100,000 people. \u201cThe statistics can be alarming,\u201d Mayor Brian Taylor told Global News. \u201cCertainly we are very alarmed here and I want to encourage everyone to get out and get vaccinated.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The city, like many in B.C., is slowly reopening and residents say they are concerned about living in a hot spot. \u201cWe have actually a lot of immunocompromised people here,\u201d said market vendor Stephanie Lang. \u201cThat means it\u2019s a really scary time for most people.\u201d Some residents suggest school transmission may be behind the increase in cases while others suspect pandemic fatigue may be to blame. \u201cI think what happened is probably complacency, people are getting a little tired,\u201d Werner said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing cases rise in areas where vaccination levels are low,\u201d Sally Otto, a UBC mathematical biologist and member of the B.C. COVID-19 Modelling Group told Global News. But Otto said the situation in the affected communities is not as bad as it was before mass immunizations. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cNone of these hot spots are anywhere near the worst of the hot spots that we saw a couple months ago.\u201d Otto said it\u2019s important for faith and community leaders to step up and help encourage people to get the shot, which Taylor is doing. \u201cGet out and get vaccinated especially the young people,\u201d said Taylor, who believes the 20 to 40 age group is the target population for moving us forward. Interior Health is holding vaccination clinics at the Grand Forks Curling Club, where there was no line-up during drop-in hours on Saturday. While Global News saw several residents stopping by to get their second jab, Taylor is hoping those who\u2019ve been procrastinating will take the opportunity to get their first vaccine. Grand Forks recorded 11 new COVID-19 cases between May 30 and June 5. The mayor said his city is a safe place and will be open to local tourists again \u2013 once health officials give the green light for travel across the province. \u201cI\u2019d like us to be known as the hot spot for something different than that,\u201d Taylor added."},

For comparison, last Sunday 2,199 cases were reported. Fifteen new deaths were also announced on May 23, bringing the provincial death toll to 8,614. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t A total of 493,179 coronavirus cases are considered resolved, which is up by 2,458 and is 94.4 per cent of all confirmed cases. More than 31,200 additional tests were completed. Ontario has now completed a total of 15,004,716 tests and 9,513 remain under investigation.

Oxygen is in short supply,\u201d said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, adding that almost one in four tests for the virus were giving a positive result. \u201cBeds equipped with oxygen supplies, and for critical care, are filling fast,\u201d he added. New Delhi, which has imposed a weekend curfew, is among the worst hit cities in , where a second major wave of coronavirus infections is straining health infrastructure. In recent weeks, criticism has mounted over how the federal government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has handled the health crisis, as religious festivals and election rallies continue despite reports of shortages of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and vaccination doses. After imposing one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns for nearly three months last year, \u2019s government relaxed almost all curbs by the beginning of 2021, although many regions like New Delhi and state of Maharashtra have introduced localised restrictions. \u201cThis is Narendra Modi\u2019s biggest crisis yet. It is bigger than any security threat, external or internal, or even the economic attrition of 2020,\u201d political commentator Shekhar Gupta wrote in a column on Saturday. As complaints rise about slow vaccination rollout and shortages, Federal Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday said 125 million doses have already been administered and 11.6 million doses would be made available in a week. Some local governments \u2013 including in the New Delhi city \u2013 have raised concerns over shortages and hoarding of anti-viral drug Remdesivir. Nawab Malik, a minister from Maharashtra, accused Modi\u2019s federal government on Twitter for restricting Remdesivir supplies to the state. A minister in Modi\u2019s cabinet, Mansukh Mandaviya, denied the allegation, saying adequate supplies were being arranged. Mandaviya said on Twitter the government had intervened and prices of Remdesivir injections have been significantly reduced. After hundreds of thousands of ascetics and devout Hindus gathered for several days along the banks of the Ganges for a religious festival Kumbh Mela, Modi on Saturday called for restraint, saying on Twitter the festival should now be kept \u201csymbolic\u201d. Responding to Modi\u2019s appeal, one of the religious leaders Swami Avdheshanand urged devotees to not gather in large numbers. Devout Hindus believe bathing in the holy Ganges absolves people of sins, and during the Kumbh Mela, brings salvation from the cycle of life and death. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Those returning to Mumbai from the Kumbh Mela will have to quarantine, the city mayor said.

An analysis of data compiled by Global News found the seven-day average as of Nov. 24 was 2,588 cases per day \u2014 down 40 percent from two months ago, but up nearly 15 per cent since Nov. 1. \u00a0 As of Nov. 24, more than 59,842,420 doses of approved COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across Canada. So far, 30,194,390 Canadians have received at least one dose of an approved COVID-19 vaccine, while 28,913,875 Canadians are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with two doses. Since they were authorized in September, 1,026,286\u00a0third \u201cbooster\u201d doses have been administered, according to available provincial and territorial data. As of Nov. 24, 83 per cent of eligible Canadians aged five and up have received at least one dose of the vaccine, while 79.5 per cent are fully vaccinated with two shots. Vaccinations for children aged five to 11 were approved by Health Canada in mid-November. Hospitalizations, which also saw a significant climb along with cases this summer, are now on the decline. As of Nov. 24, the latest seven-day average of those seeking treatment in hospital for COVID-19 has now dropped down to 1,580 patients per day. About 440 people are currently being treated in intensive care units, marking a slow decline after staying steady throughout much of October. The average number of deaths per day now sits around 20, marking another fall from the latest peak seen last month. Federal modelling done in April and May suggested that if 75 per cent of eligible Canadians had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 20 per cent had two, provinces could safely begin easing restrictions on public movement without overwhelming hospitals again. But Canada\u2019s chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam says the variants used to develop those models didn\u2019t include Delta, which is the most infectious one tracked in Canada to date, believed to cause more severe illness, and has become the dominant variant in the country. She says cautious, staged reopenings, which leave lots of room to monitor an increase in case counts and detect surges of variants like Delta, will be critical. Other variants of concern, like the Alpha variant that was first identified in the United Kingdom, are also continuing to spread across the country. The province says 91 per cent of eligible people have received their first dose of a vaccine and 87.4 per cent of eligible people have received a second dose. Of the active cases, 318 were in hospital and 109 were in intensive care. The province says people not fully vaccinated against the virus accounted for 58.1 per cent of cases in the past two weeks. On Wednesday, B.C. became the first province to introduce a paid sick leave program that has been called for since the beginning of the pandemic. The plan ensures employers provide a minimum of five paid sick days for workers across the province. Premier Jason Kenney says\u00a0Alberta\u00a0will begin taking online\u00a0COVID-19 vaccination bookings for youngsters starting Wednesday morning. Kenney says the province has now received doses of the modified pediatric Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children age 5 to 11 and will distribute the vaccines to 120 locations provincewide over the next two days. He says 391,000 children are now eligible for vaccines, meaning that 94 per cent of all Albertans can get them. Kenney is urging hesitant parents to seek out information on the efficacy of the drug, which Health Canada says is almost 91 per cent effective with no identifiable side effects. Alberta\u00a0joins other provinces set to begin administering the vaccines to children this week, some as early as Wednesday. The first shipment of the vaccine arrived Sunday and Canada expects to soon have almost three million doses. Clinics in Regina and Saskatoon have begun immunizing children between five and 11 years old against\u00a0COVID-19. More clinics are to open in smaller centres in the province Thursday. Premier Scott Moe said Tuesday that more than 12,000 appointments for youngsters had been booked. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends an interval of at least eight weeks between the first and second doses for a better immune response. However,\u00a0Saskatchewan\u00a0has said the second dose can be administered as early as 21 days after the first, depending on parental preference. Manitoba announced Wednesday afternoon that it had started COVID-19 vaccinations for children between the ages of five and 11 \u2014 a day ahead of schedule \u2014 due to shipments of the pediatric vaccine arriving earlier than expected. Dr. Joss Reimer, medical lead with the province\u2019s vaccine implementation group, said Wednesday there are enough vaccines to provide a first dose to all 125,000 children in the five-to-11 age group. The shots will be administered at regional vaccine clinics, physician clinics, urban Indigenous clinics, pharmacies and pop-up community clinics and will be available in some schools in the coming days and weeks. The start of vaccinations for under-12s marks another chapter in Canada\u2019s immunization effort, as provinces race to get shots into as many arms as possible before the holiday season. Health Canada approved for children a modified version of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine last week, and the agency says the vaccine is almost 91 per cent effective. Canada is expecting an accelerated delivery of 2.9 million child-sized doses, which is enough for every child aged five to 11. Ontario\u00a0says 93,000\u00a0COVID-19 vaccine appointments were booked for kids between the ages of five and 11 as of Wednesday morning. The figure covers the provincial booking system and doesn\u2019t include other bookings made through local public health units, pharmacies and primary care offices offering the shots. The province opened bookings for kids in that age group on Tuesday morning. Kid-friendly clinics are scheduled to start in earnest on Thursday, though a few began Wednesday. Southwestern Public Health advertised a \u201climited batch\u201d of shots being offered at a Tillonsburg, Ont., clinic and a handful of clinics in Toronto were also administering the vaccines to young kids. Toronto\u2019s vaccine rollout for young children is scheduled to pick on Thursday, with some clinics at schools, doctors offices and in local communities. Other health units plan to follow with their first kid-focused clinics on Friday and more over the weekend. The inoculation of children between the ages of five and 11 began at mass vaccination centres across the province on Wednesday. It will also be possible for kids in that age group to get a shot at school starting next week. Parents should expect to see consent forms in the next few days. Bookings for kids\u2019 appointments opened up on Tuesday on the government\u2019s\u00a0 \u00a0vaccination portal . By Wednesday, 115,300 appointments had already been booked, according to Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault. Legault said there are around 650,000 eligible kids in that age group in the province. The goal is to have one dose administered by Christmas, with an eight-week delay for the second dose. Forty-five people were in hospital with\u00a0COVID-19, including 19 in intensive care, officials said in a news release. They added that more than 6,200\u00a0COVID-19 vaccination appointments had been booked for children aged five to 11. Chief medical officer Dr. Jennifer Russell said vaccinating young people is an important step for reducing the spread of the novel coronavirus. She said about 88 per cent of eligible New\u00a0Brunswick\u00a0residents were vaccinated against\u00a0COVID-19 and that 93.5 per cent have received at least one dose. Meanwhile, one-quarter of the 16 inpatient units at The Moncton Hospital were dealing with\u00a0COVID-19 outbreaks on Wednesday, and 20 patients and four staff have tested positive for the disease, officials said. The Horizon Health Network, which governs the hospital, said in a news release that evidence of\u00a0COVID-19 transmission had been detected in inpatient units over the last several days. Horizon said officials were working with the Health Department to notify anyone who may have been exposed to infected staff members or infected patients. Nova\u00a0Scotia\u00a0is expected to receive its first shipment of pediatric\u00a0COVID-19 vaccine this week, with the first shots for children aged five to 11 to be available by Dec. 2. Details of the rollout, however, will have to wait until there is certainty on the date and time of the vaccine\u2019s arrival, chief medical officer of health Dr. Robert Strang said Wednesday. Strang said\u00a0Nova\u00a0Scotia\u00a0is still waiting to finalize details because the government has requested that its bulk shipment of vaccine be broken down into smaller quantities that can be sent directly to pharmacies. Adjustments are still being made to the province\u2019s online booking system to accommodate the new age group, he added. He told reporters that once the shots become available, there would be capacity within the health system to administer first doses before Christmas to 80 per cent of the 68,000 children who are eligible. Outbreaks previously identified in the province\u2019s western and northern zones appeared to be stabilizing, officials said, although there was still evidence of low-level transmission in the northern zone. No new cases were reported at the East Cumberland Lodge long-term care home in Pugwash, N.S., which is located in the province\u2019s northern health zone. A total of 32 residents and 11 staff members at the home have tested positive, and three residents have died of the disease. Chief public health officer Dr. Heather Morrison said the new cases included one person in their 60s, four in their 50s, one in their 30s and one in their 20s. Morrison said two new cases involved people who had recently travelled outside the province, and she said five involved close contacts of previously reported infections. She said two of the five cases that were linked to prior infections came from a cluster that began in\u00a0Prince\u00a0County, and she said three cases were linked to a separate workplace outbreak that was under investigation. The\u00a0Island\u00a0has 36 active reported cases of\u00a0COVID-19. Newfoundland\u00a0and Labrador health officials say a man in the Central Health region is the 18th person to die from\u00a0COVID-19 in the province. The Health Department issued a news release Wednesday offering its condolences to the family of the man, who it says was 70 years old or older. Officials in that province say two of the new cases are in the central region and that two are in the eastern region. Newfoundland\u00a0and Labrador has 13 active reported infections. COVID-19 vaccinations for children in\u00a0Yukon\u00a0between the ages of five and 11 will start in early December. Premier Sandy Silver says being able to vaccinate kids is what the territory \u201chas been waiting for.\u201d He encouraged parents to get their children vaccinated as soon as possible. The territory\u2019s acting chief medical officer of health, Dr. Andre Corriveau, says health-care workers are seeing the rate of active cases beginning to drop. The territory has also launched its vaccination verification smartphone app, which will help businesses confirm a person\u2019s vaccination status. Silver says no private data will be stored on the app and it will help make life easier for businesses and people. Schools in Yellowknife and surrounding areas reopened last month after a six-week closure during a widespread outbreak of COVID-19 in the Northwest Territories. Cases have declined in the territory after hitting a peak of 460 on Oct. 7, which was the highest per capita rate in the country. Classrooms had been shuttered since Sept. 13 and the city had been under tight restrictions between then and late October, when some measures were eased. Businesses in the N.W.T. can also apply to increase their capacity if they agree to check people\u2019s vaccination status and only allow access to those who are fully immunized. Dr. Kami Kandola, chief public health officer, cautioned residents that while cases have declined, the virus is still spreading in the territory, and urged people to continue following existing health measures. People in\u00a0Nunavut\u00a0can now get proof of\u00a0COVID-19 vaccination certificates. Nunavut\u2019s health department says the certificates comply with federal proof of vaccination requirements for travel and for access to non-essential services in other jurisdictions. The certificate includes a person\u2019s name, date of birth, vaccination information and a QR code. People can pick up the certificates at their local health centres or hospital, Iqaluit Public Health or during clinics at Iqaluit\u2019s cadet hall. Officials say those travelling into\u00a0Nunavut\u00a0still need to request a vaccine exemption letter to enter the territory and note the certificate does not replace that process. Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are legally obligated to self-isolate for 14 days, beginning March 26, in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others. Some provinces and territories have also implemented additional recommendations or enforcement measures to ensure those returning to the area self-isolate. \u00a0can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing \u2014 very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms,\u00a0 . To\u00a0 , experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out."},

In a tweet, Hinshaw said Friday\u2019s COVID-19 numbers would be delayed due to a technical error. However, she provided some daily estimates. Alberta Health had identified about 100 new cases in the last 24 hours out of approximately 6,100 tests, she said. That put Alberta\u2019s positivity rate at about 1.7 per cent. There were about 1,500 active cases on Friday, Hinshaw said. \u00a0"},

While the data will change daily, here is a breakdown of the percentage of people who have received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine in Edmonton\u2019s neighbourhoods as of May 16: Charlene Vu is the pharmacy manager at an I.D.A. Pharmacy in Abbotsfield, where vaccination rates were lower than all other Edmonton regions as of May 16. \u201cIt does concern me,\u201d Vu said, adding she does what she can to speak to clients and educate them on vaccine safety. \u201cEvery day, whoever comes through our pharmacy, we advise them to get vaccinated as soon as they can,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have done our best to vaccinate as many people as we can\u2026 I try to approach my patients to advise them to vaccinate so that we can get back to our normal life. And, to tell you the truth, 99 per cent that I approach, they agree to do it. Even right on the spot.\u201d Areas of note surrounding Edmonton include Sherwood Park with 53.1 per cent of people immunized with one dose, St. Albert with 56 per cent, Beaumont with 42 per cent, and Leduc and Devon with 40.4 per cent, as of May 16. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Here\u2019s a look at the breakdown of the percentage of the population with one dose of vaccine by neighbourhood in Calgary as of May 16: Areas of note surrounding Calgary include Canmore at 45.7 per cent of the population having received one dose of vaccine, Banff at 42.9 per cent and Airdrie at 33.9 per cent as of May 16. Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi noted the variable uptake in different regions of the city. He said while the province hasn\u2019t made any firm decisions on pop-up vaccine clinics, he believes they would be beneficial. \u201cIf we can find ways to do pop-ups to make it more convenient for people, I believe we should do that. And we\u2019re just waiting on some guidance from the province on what that will look like,\u201d Nenshi said. \u201cI think it\u2019s shift work more than anything else. You know, for a lot of folks, you\u2019ll take the appointment whenever you get it and you can afford to take a couple of hours off work and just go get it done. And although we do have a policy that allows you to get time off work to get your vaccination, it\u2019s not always practical or easy to do that if you\u2019re running your own business or if you\u2019re the only one at the counter at the store, you can\u2019t always just say, \u2018I gotta go for three hours and get my vaccine.\u2019 So it\u2019s about going to people where they live and making it easy for them.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t On May 13, Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health said pop-up vaccination clinics are being considered, but a number of factors have to be considered. On Tuesday afternoon, Dr. Deena Hinshaw said health officials are working with local community leaders in areas where case rates are high and vaccination uptake is lower, to ensure vaccines are being offered in ways that are the most effective for their regions. \u201cWe are looking at a province-wide approach to making sure that those areas with high cases and low immunization coverage, that we\u2019re looking at what the barriers are and then looking at ways to most effectively address those barriers,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that we have been looking at and wanting to make sure that both the questions about physical barriers \u2014 such as logistics and hours of clinics, those kind of things \u2014 as well as information provision, trusted providers partnering with local community leaders. \u201cWe have been working for many months with local community leaders in many areas to support information provision and now we\u2019re just having the discussions about the potential next steps for the areas in the province, again, that have those two metrics of concern with high rates and low uptake.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Lethbridge is broken down as follows for those with one dose of vaccine as of May 16: Red Deer is broken down as follows for those with one dose of vaccine as of May 16: Regions in northern Alberta include 24.2 per cent of people in Wood Buffalo having one dose as of May 16, 9.8 per cent of people in the High Level region, 28.5 per cent of people in Grande Prairie County and 37.9 per cent of people in the Jasper region. Kirsten Fiest, an epidemiology professor at the University of Calgary, said bringing vaccines to people in neighbourhoods with lower uptake should be a priority as soon as possible. \u201cWe need to be taking the vaccines to people yesterday. We need to be out there making it as easy as possible for people to get the vaccine,\u201d Fiest said Tuesday morning. \u201cWe need to reduce disparities and access to vaccinations by going to neighbourhoods where people are not being vaccinated as much and bringing the vaccine to them as opposed to waiting for them to come to the vaccines. \u201cWe need to be going to them and ensuring that those highly vulnerable people, those people working on the frontlines, essential workers are protected from COVID.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Alberta Health spokesperson Tom McMillan said now that vaccines are available to all Albertans 12 and older, the government is working on a strategy to help specific groups and areas access vaccines. \u201cThis may include targeting areas where there is currently low coverage and where people may have challenges accessing currently available options,\u201d McMillan said in a statement to Global News. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve prioritized making sure that vaccines are readily accessible and available to all Albertans. This includes utilizing more than 1,300 pharmacies, AHS clinics in all regions and some physician offices.\u201d McMillan also pointed to temporary vaccine clinics that were used to vaccinate people working at meatpacking plants and Alberta work camps, where groups were \u201cuniquely at risk of severe outbreaks.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t As of Tuesday, more than 50 per cent of Albertans 12 and older have received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. \u201cThis is a significant feat and something that we should all be proud of. It is further proof that we are getting closer to the end and that things are getting better,\u201d Hinshaw said. So far, more than 2.2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Alberta. All Albertans age 12 and older are eligible to book an appointment to be vaccinated.

But it hasn\u2019t dried up completely \u2014 at least 123 people died from complications of COVID-19 between May 3 to May 31. Those most at risk of death early in the pandemic \u2014 the elderly \u2014 were also the first to get their shots and have seen the fatality rate drop precipitously since the mass vaccination campaign began. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe\u2019re having high levels of protection once there has been a three-week interval from the first dose, so that\u2019s in the high 90 per cent,\u201d family physician Dr. Birinder Narang told Global News. \u201cWhere we have the strongest data is coming from the nursing homes, because that\u2019s where we started vaccinating late December, early January.\u201d According to the BC Centre for Disease Control, deaths among people aged over 80 fell by 81 per cent from late December to mid-February. Deaths among those aged 70-79 fell by 87 per cent. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t So who is most at risk now? According to St. Paul\u2019s Hospital respirologist Dr. Don Sin, it\u2019s adults who have yet to get their first dose. \u201cThere may be one or two or three individuals who may succumb to the disease despite full vaccination,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would say the majority have not received the vaccination who have developed very severe COVID.\u201d As of last weekend, there were just under 40 patients in the intensive care unit at Surrey Memorial Hospital, the majority of whom were unvaccinated, according to Fraser Health. Asked about how many of the 123 deaths in May were unvaccinated patients, the Ministry of Health would only say it has identified a small number of infections among those who had been immunized. Those infections are generally milder than those in unvaccinated people, according to the ministry. At a May 13 presentation, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said B.C. had identified 30 deaths among \u201cbreakthrough\u201d cases \u2014 people who had developed COVID-19 three or more weeks after getting their first dose of vaccine. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t At the time, B.C. had administered about 1.7 million vaccines. The average age of those deaths was 87. In the same presentation, Henry said the province had recorded 120 cases of patients who had developed COVID-19 more than three weeks after having a second dose. Some of those people, Sin said, may have already had a depressed immune system and who, despite vaccines, were unable to produce enough antibodies to fight the virus off. \u201cSo, those who are on immunosuppressive medications, those who are on dialysis, those who are on chemotherapy, those who are elderly, and for that reason alone, may not mount a good antibody response \u2014 these are the individuals who, despite having one vaccine jab, can get covered and become quite ill with the disease,\u201d Sin said. The best way to protect yourself from developing a serious infection, he added, is to ensure you were in line to get fully immunized as early as possible. \u201cIn my personal practice, I haven\u2019t encountered anyone who had received two doses of the vaccine who became very ill from it. I have yet to see that,\u201d Sin said. I\u2019m extremely optimistic. I think countries that have had great success in getting two shots into to their citizens have experienced dramatic fall off in the case numbers of covert fatalities from COVID, hospitalizations from COVID \u2014 and in Canada, we\u2019ll see the same thing as soon as we have 50, 60, 70 per cent of adults with two shots of the vaccine.\u201d As of Friday, just under 257,000, or about five per cent, of all British Columbians had received their second dose."},
{"title": "Alberta changes quarantine requirements for close contacts who are vaccinated against COVID-19  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted May 20, 2021 11:54 am", "body": "Alberta is making changes to the quarantine requirements for people who have both received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and to those who have been fully vaccinated. The changes come as Alberta identified 812 new cases of   Thursday.  Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health announced separate changes Thursday afternoon, which apply to close contacts of COVID-19 cases who have received one dose of vaccine and those who are two weeks past being fully immunized. \u201cIt only applies to those that have received the vaccine,\u201d Dr. Deena Hinshaw stressed. \u201cFor those that have not gotten any doses, there is no change to the 14-day quarantine period.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Up until now, all Albertans \u2014 regardless of their vaccination status \u2014 were legally required to quarantine for 14 days if they were a close contact of a COVID-19 case. Effective immediately, individuals who have received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine will have a shortened quarantine period if they are determined to be a close contact of a confirmed case. The quarantine period will be shortened from 14 days to 10 days as long as the close contact has no symptoms. Close contacts will still be required to get a COVID-19 test. However, if individuals with one dose of vaccine receive a negative COVID-19 test on Day 7 or later in the quarantine period, they will be able to stop quarantining. If the test comes back positive, the current isolation rules still apply, Hinshaw explained. Close contacts who have symptoms also will still have to follow the current isolation rules. Albertans who are close contacts and have received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine \u2014 and at least two weeks have passed since they received their second dose \u2014 will no longer be required to quarantine at all if they have no symptoms. If a fully vaccinated person has even minor symptoms, Hinshaw said they must isolate and go for a COVID-19 test as usual. If that test comes back negative, the person will not be required to quarantine further. However, if the test is positive, the individual must isolate for 10 days from when their symptoms started. \u201cThis is for close contacts who have received both doses of a vaccine,\u201d Hinshaw stressed. The new rules do not apply to returning international travellers. All Albertans returning from international travel, regardless of their vaccination status, are still required to quarantine for two weeks. Hinshaw said the change to the quarantine period aligns with changes made in Ontario and Manitoba. \u201cWhile vaccines don\u2019t erase all possibility of infection, the data shows the vaccine reduces the amount of virus in the person\u2019s body, even if someone does get infected, which further reduces the risk of transmission. This is good news,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also know there is good short-term protection in those who have received just one dose of a two-dose series.\u201d The new quarantine requirements will also mean less disruptions for families, workplaces and schools, while still preventing the spread of COVID-19, Hinshaw said. \u201cRegardless of whether someone has had one, two or no doses, all of the other restrictions in place still apply.\u201d Hinshaw said contact tracers and case investigators have the ability to collect and use personal health information, so they will ensure people have received their vaccine when following up with close contacts. \u201cPeople will need to be able to share with the contact tracer the type of vaccine they had, the date that they got it, so that that contact tracer can verify the time period between the dose that they received and when the exposure happened, and verify that they meet the criteria.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t So far, nearly 51 per cent of eligible Albertans 12 and older have received at least one dose of vaccine. More than 2.3 million doses of vaccine have been administered in Alberta. \u201cThe response from Albertans to get their COVID-19 vaccine has been incredibly encouraging,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cWe are making real progress.\u201d More information on the new quarantine requirements for vaccinated individuals can be found on  . Alberta identified 812 new cases of COVID-19 Thursday. Those came after about 9,000 tests were processed, putting the province\u2019s positivity rate at 9.3 per cent. There are now 17,675 active cases of COVID-19 in Alberta, down from 18,813 active cases Wednesday. There are now 665 people in hospital with COVID-19, 177 of whom are being treated in intensive care. Four additional deaths were reported to Alberta Health in the last 24 hours, bringing the province\u2019s death toll to 2,162. \u201cI extend my sympathies to all who are experiencing loss at this time, whether from COVID-19 or any other cause,\u201d Hinshaw said. A man in his 40s and a man in his 70s in the Edmonton zone died. A man in his 60s and a man in his 70s in the Calgary zone died.

Speaking at a news conference Friday morning, chief public health officer   told reporters she expects the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) will make recommendations on whether or not additional doses for those at the highest risk are needed. In particular, the committee is looking at those who received a COVID-19 vaccine around the beginning of the year, Tam added. \u201cSo that includes, for example, those in long-term care homes or congregate living for seniors,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I expect the committee to have their deliberations completed on this group \u2026 very shortly.\u201d Tam did not elaborate on a timeline further, but her comments come after the United States approved booster shots for Americans aged 65 and older, adults with underlying medical conditions and adults in high-risk settings, like a workplace or congregate living. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) endorsed the plan on Thursday, which is in line with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s authorization of the extra shot earlier this week. Pfizer-BioNTech is the vaccine of choice. The extra shots will also be rolled out in long-term care facilities and are open to more than 20 million Americans who received their second Pfizer shot more than six months ago. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Tam said in addition to looking at American data on boosters, Canada has its own measures to follow as its vaccine approach is different. \u201cFor example, while we use the mRNA vaccines that are the same as the United States, many Canadians actually had an extended interval compared to the United States, and what the data is showing us is that the extended interval produces a more robust immune response and vaccine effectiveness is better with a longer interval,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the Canadian data must be analyzed on top of what we\u2019re gathering from the international community as well, and we are taking a thorough, thoughtful and phased approach to looking at additional doses.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Canada has already OK\u2019d additional doses for some immunocompromised individuals, announcing the new measure on Sept. 10. \u201cNACI continues to examine the need for booster doses, which unlike additional doses are intended to restore initially adequate immune protection that may have waned over time,\u201d Tam said at the time. Booster shots, however, continue to be a divisive issue among health experts and internationally. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Vaccine inequity was among the agenda items at the United Nations\u2019 annual meeting this week. The leaders of many African countries, whose populations have little to no access to the shots, spoke out. It is \u201cof great concern\u201d that the global community has not supported the principles \u201cof solidarity and co-operation in securing equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa\u2019s president, said. \u201cIt is an indictment on humanity that more than 82 per cent of the world\u2019s vaccine doses have been acquired by wealthy countries, while less than one per cent has gone to low-income countries.\u201d On Wednesday during a global COVID-19 summit, President Joe Biden announced the U.S. would double its purchase of Pfizer\u2019s shots to share one billion doses with the world, in an effort to vaccinate 70 per cent of the global population within the next year. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who was also in attendance, committed to that goal. \u201cIn order to get this done, Canada will build on the important progress we have made so far, and focus on increasing the production, availability, and delivery of vaccines,\u201d a   said. \u201cTo date, Canada has contributed more than $2.5 billion to help address this crisis globally. We have also committed to sharing tens of millions of vaccine doses with the rest of the world, including through the COVAX facility.\u201d Tam said on Friday that more than 80 per cent of Canada\u2019s eligible population is now fully vaccinated against COVID-19. According to  , 32.71 per cent of the world\u2019s population is fully inoculated. Earlier this month, University of Toronto bioethics professor Kerry Bowman   that Canada needs to fight the pandemic with a global approach. \u201cBooster shots may well be required for immunocompromised people and a subset of people, (but) I think in the short term, we should not have widespread booster shots \u2014 meaning third doses \u2014 at all, for ethical reasons and epidemiological reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really have to start making a deeper commitment to the larger world to protect ourselves and because it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d"},

This week\u2019s votes came as Ontario\u2019s COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, a body of 40 doctors, medical experts and scientists, released a joint letter on Tuesday urging stronger public health measures to be imposed. Among the six priority areas was the need to ensure essential workers are paid to stay home when they are sick, when they are exposed to COVID-19, or when they need time to get vaccinated. \u201cAn emergency benefit that offers more money, is easily accessible, immediately paid and that, for the duration of the pandemic, is available to essential workers \u2013 when they are sick, when they\u2019ve been exposed, need time off to get tested, or when it\u2019s their turn to get vaccinated \u2013 will help limit spread,\u201d the letter said. At Queen\u2019s Park Wednesday afternoon, Ontario NDP Leader Andrea Horwath questioned why paid vaccination time hasn\u2019t been implemented yet. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense that any worker should have to worry about booking an appointment that\u2019s the most expedient to get their shot and then having to perhaps not take that appointment because it\u2019s interfering with their work hours and they\u2019re afraid of losing pay,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea that paid vaccination time is happening with public workers I\u2019m happy about that, but it needs to be there for every single worker in our province just like it is when you go vote.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In a March 16 memo written by Kevin French, the deputy minister of the Treasury Board Secretariat, and shared with Global News by an Ontario government employee, it outlines the importance of eligible workers for getting vaccinations under phase two of the provincial rollout. \u201cWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has brought many challenges, planning for the commencement of phase two signals an important step to restarting Ontario\u2019s economy,\u201d the memo said. The memo, which was sent to the entire public service, went on to describe the need to provide \u201cas much flexibility as possible\u201d when employees get vaccination booking times. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cTo support OPS employees and ensure the safety of those working around them, employees, whose vaccination appointment falls during their regularly scheduled work hours, will not be required to use an existing credit or take unpaid time off to attend their appointment,\u201d the document said. \u201cWhere operationally feasible, employees will need to provide as much advance notice as possible and work with their manager. Managers will be expected to continue to provide flexibility to staff during this time to ensure ongoing operations.\u201d A spokesperson for Treasury Board President Peter Bethlenfalvy told Global News after the publication of this story that the decision was made by the Ontario Public Service and wasn\u2019t made based on government input.  \u201cIt is the expectation of OPS management that staff will make every effort to schedule their vaccine appointments outside of their regularly scheduled working hours. However, where an OPS employee may have an extenuating circumstance that results in a vaccine appointment occurring during their scheduled work hours, managers will work with staff to provide flexibility where possible based on operational requirements,\u201d Sebastian Skamski wrote in a statement, adding there were no additional entitlements being provided. \u201cIt is important to note that now and throughout the pandemic, roughly 50 per cent of OPS employees are working in person at their workplaces to provide critical frontline services.\u201d The statement didn\u2019t address if the government was moving to put in place requirements for private-sector employers, Skamski encouraged businesses to support their employees. \u201cThe government encourages all employers to accommodate their employees\u2019 vaccination appointments to ensure they can provide the safest working conditions for their employees and to ensure their workforce is safe healthy and safe,\u201d he wrote. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t When asked about the matter Wednesday afternoon, Government House Leader Paul Calandra didn\u2019t directly answer the question. However, in a recent change in messaging on paid sick days, he acknowledged more needs to be done to help essential workers. \u201cThey are so important to the continuation of our economy, to helping us defeat this pandemic,\u201d he said, reiterating the government is looking at bringing forward some sort of measures to address \u201cgaps\u201d in the federal government\u2019s program. Government officials have rejected cries from medical experts and advocates for an Ontario paid sick leave program throughout the pandemic multiple times over several months, citing the federal Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB). As the third wave worsens in Ontario, critics said provincial paid sick leave could help to curb surging numbers. Calandra recently said he anticipated the federal government would announce further enhancements to their sick-day program on Monday when the federal budget was announced. However, once announced, the budget did not implement any changes to CRSB, which pays $500 per week ($450 after taxes) for up to four weeks for anyone required to quarantine because of COVID-19. Advocates previously said under the federal program, workers need to apply after being sick and they need to have been away for a majority of days they were scheduled to work in a week. Many have raised that it can take weeks to get reimbursement. When it comes to a provincial sick leave program, advocates said they want to see it operate like a wage continuance. Such a mechanism, if approved, would see workers be paid as normal if they have to stay home."},

The attacks on the United States Capitol is one example. Rousseau said young men between 15 and 35 years old who spend most of their time on the internet are most at risk of becoming radicalized. \u201cAnd what they will find online is war is coming, you should defend yourself,\u201d said Rousseau. \u201cThe main threat in Canada comes from isolated individuals who are in despair, who are distressed, who are enraged, and who may want to die while taking other people\u2019s lives,\u201d she said. However, she says not all people who believe in conspiracy theories will become violent. \u201cIn Quebec, you have a group of people who adhere to anti-mask theories who are women, middle-aged women, who will not endorse violence,\u201d Rousseau said.

Since Jan. 1, 96 per cent of Alberta\u2019s confirmed COVID-19 cases were in individuals who were either unvaccinated or still within the two-week window after receiving their first dose, where their immunity hadn\u2019t built up. In the same time frame, Hinshaw said only 0.2 per cent of people contracted COVID-19 after that two-week window. \u201cThis shows you the power of the vaccine at preventing infection.\u201d She added that 93 per cent of Alberta COVID-19 cases that required hospitalization were also either people who weren\u2019t vaccinated or who were diagnosed within two weeks of their first dose. Between Jan. 1 and Wednesday, there were 706 deaths due to COVID-19 in Alberta. Hinshaw said 88 per cent of those were unvaccinated, or had been diagnosed within that two-week period. \u201cThese numbers reinforce just how important vaccines are,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cWhile no vaccine or treatment for any condition is ever perfect, these vaccines work better than we could have expected.\u201d As of Thursday\u2019s update, Alberta had administered 2,888,005 doses of COVID-19 vaccine. On Wednesday alone, the province gave more than 44,000 shots. \u201cWe can expect both the number of hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19 to decrease even more as more of the population is protected by first and second doses,\u201d Hinshaw said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Alberta data also shows the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are effective against the B.1.1.7 variant \u2013 also known as the variant first identified in the United Kingdom. One shot of these vaccines gives a person about 73 per cent protection against that variant. After two doses, its effectiveness goes up to 91 per cent. Against the P.1 variant \u2013 the variant first identified Brazil \u2013 these mRNA vaccines are about 75 per cent effective after one dose and 89 per cent effective after two doses. Hinshaw said there wasn\u2019t enough data to say how effective the AstraZeneca vaccine is against these variants, but that information will be released as it\u2019s received. On Thursday, the province confirmed an additional 296 cases over the previous 24 hours. The province conducted 6,808 tests, putting the positivity rate at about 4.6 per cent. An additional 305 cases of variants were also confirmed over the last 24 hours. Alberta currently has 411 people in hospital with COVID-19, with 120 of those people in the ICU. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Five additional deaths were reported to Alberta Health over the last 24 hours. Four of the deaths included known comorbidities: a man in his 80s, a woman in her 50s and a man in his 70s in the Edmonton zone and a man in his 80s in the Calgary zone have died. A woman in her 70s with no known comorbidities has also died in the Edmonton zone. \u201cWe must never forget that these are not just numbers,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cThey are people who lost their lives to COVID-19 and who leave behind family and friends who are grieving them.\u201d There are active alerts or outbreaks in 364 schools. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Now that Alberta is again screening all positive COVID-19 cases for variants, case investigation teams will start second calls for cases involving the P.1 variant and B.1.617 \u2013the variant first identified in India \u2014 again. \u201cThe second notification will allow AHS to do even more in-depth investigations to find out where the case may have been exposed,\u201d Hinshaw said. The province stopped the practice May 1 as labs didn\u2019t have the capacity to keep up as the number of daily cases started topping 2,000 per day. Hinshaw said the province wants to pay particular attention to the low-volume variants of concern. \u201cIn these cases we have opportunities for more aggressive containment.\u201d Second calls will not take place for cases of the B.1.17 variant as it is already the dominant strain in the province, Hinshaw said."},

Deaths from COVID-19 swelled by 4,205, while daily coronavirus cases rose by 348,421, with India\u2019s overall number of cases surging past 23 million, according to health ministry data. Even then, experts believe the official numbers grossly underestimate the real scale of the epidemic\u2019s impact, and actual deaths and infections could be five to ten times higher. India\u2019s COVID-19 infection curve may be showing early signs of flattening, but the decline in the number of new infections is likely to be slow, said Shahid Jameel, a top Indian virologist. \u201cIt is still too early to say whether we have reached the peak,\u201d he was quoted as saying by the Indian Express newspaper. \u201cThere is some indication of the cases plateauing. But we must not forget that this is a very high plateau. We seem to be plateauing around 400,000 cases a day.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t India, with a population of 1.4 billion people, currently accounts for one in three of the reported deaths from coronavirus around the world, according to a Reuters tally, overwhelming hospital and medical staff, as well as mortuaries and crematoriums. Drugs and medical oxygen are in short supply. The brutal second wave of COVID-19 infections has spread from the cities to small towns and the countryside, ripping through a fragile health system ill-equipped for a crisis of this scale. Rural parts of India are also running short of wood for traditional Hindu cremations and scores of bodies are washing up on the banks of the Ganges river which flows through the most populous areas of the northern plains. Akhand Pratap, a resident of Ghazipur district in sprawling Uttar Pradesh state, said that \u201cpeople are immersing bodies in the holy Ganges river instead of cremation because of shortage of cremation wood\u201d. Even in the capital, New Delhi, many COVID victims are abandoned by their relatives after cremation, leaving volunteers to wash the ashes, pray over them, and then take them to scatter into the river, rituals usually conducted by the family. In a report published Wednesday, the World Health Organization said the B.1.617 variant first identified in India had been detected in at least 44 countries so far. The global health body has classified it as a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d that requires heightened tracking and analysis. Indian scientists say their work to detect the variant at home has been hindered by bureaucratic obstacles and the government\u2019s reluctance to share vital data. India is sequencing around 1% of its total cases, and not all of the results are uploaded to the global database of coronavirus genomes. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Indian health officials have cautioned that it is too soon to attribute the nation\u2019s surge solely to such variants. Experts point out that the spread was catalyzed by government decisions to not pause religious gatherings and crowded election rallies. Vaccines are also running short, especially in Maharashtra state around the financial centre of Mumbai, and in the capital, Delhi, two of India\u2019s hardest-hit regions. India\u2019s second wave of the pandemic has increased calls for a nationwide lockdown and prompted more and more states to impose tougher restrictions that have hurt businesses and the wider economy."},

You now need proof  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted May 13, 2021 5:22 pm", "body": "Alberta will now require anyone who has a medical exemption for   amid the   pandemic to carry a letter of proof stating the reason they\u2019re exempt. Officials have also honed a list of conditions that qualify. Chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said there are limited health issues that absolve Albertans from having to comply with the province\u2019s mandatory face covering law, and said Alberta Health is clarifying those conditions to help prevent viral spread, and make sure people are masking properly. The health conditions include: \u201cEffective today, in order to verify that someone has a medical condition that makes them unable to wear a mask, Albertans with these conditions will require a medical exception letter from a health professional,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cThis letter is important to have, especially if requested by enforcement officials for not complying with the legal requirement to wear a mask in indoor public spaces.\u201d She said the letters have to be issued by a nurse practitioner, physician or psychologist. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Hinshaw said Alberta Health received feedback on how to make the provincial public health orders \u201cmore enforceable,\u201d and said having letters of proof will support those on the front lines of enforcement to do their jobs. She also said officials have received reports from both staff and journalists of people \u201cseeking loopholes\u201d in the regulations. \u201cThat\u2019s sometimes challenging our local law enforcement teams to be able to remind people of the importance of following these rules, and the fact that they are not optional \u2014 they are mandatory,\u201d she said. Alberta has seen a number of anti-mask and anti-restrictions protests and rallies in recent weeks, including a  , which have netted charges against organizers of the events. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Dr. Christine Gibson is a family doctor in Calgary. While she thinks it\u2019s great more stringent rules are being putting in place to ensure masks are worn, she is a bit concerned because of how busy family physicians are. \u201cThere are so many people who will be asking that don\u2019t really have a legitimate reason. There\u2019s very few legitimate medical conditions that would require a mask exemption,\u201d she said. \u201cFor us to take the time that it requires to go through all of these requests, is onerous and I think it\u2019s unfortunate that this is the way it went.\u201d Gibson also questioned the timing of the new rule. \u201cI think it is incredibly strange to be asking this more than a year into this pandemic, to be solidifying the exemption conditions that do qualify,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we are in a very intense third wave here in Alberta, we\u2019re among the highest rates globally and so I can understand why they\u2019re looking to tighten the public health restrictions that do exist, although they are looser than many of us would like.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Gibson said so far, she hasn\u2019t booked many appointments for patients who are seeking an exemption. She said most of her patients are happy to be wearing masks. \u201cI\u2019ve had a couple, one in particular worked in public and I did refuse that exemption. They said the mask made them anxious and so we talked about strategies that they could use the mask. They wanted to use a face shield instead and so I discussed with them that the science didn\u2019t hold that the face shield was going to be adequately protective for them or others. \u201cI was not able to write that mask exemption. It was not a legitimate reason and it was going to put the public at risk, as well as this particular person.\u201d Hinshaw said similar approaches to medical exceptions to the mask law are already being used in Saskatchewan and Quebec, and Alberta\u2019s move to require a letter of proof was made based on medical evidence. \u201cThis change is not meant to punish people unfairly. It\u2019s meant to ensure anyone who is capable of wearing a mask complies with this public health measure intended to keep us all safe, which is especially important during this third wave.\u201d In addition to these exemptions, people don\u2019t have to wear a mask indoors in certain circumstances, including if they can\u2019t put on or take off a mask independently, if they are eating or drinking while seated, or if there\u2019s an occupational risk to wearing one. Hinshaw said more information about what information is needed in an exemption letter will be published online. \u201cGuidance has been shared with the professional colleges of the health-care practitioners who are authorized to write these letters,\u201d she said. The City of Edmonton said its enforcement officers will take the next week to educate people on the new rules. This will also give people who are exempt time to get a doctor\u2019s letter, the city said. \u201cFollowing the completion of the city\u2019s education period, people who are not able to provide a letter will receive either a warning or a ticket under the provincial health order.

{"title": "A look at the difference between COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and effectiveness - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted March 14, 2021 12:31 pm", "body": "As Canada approves more   vaccines, health officials are advising to take the first one made available to you despite its efficacy rate. Experts say a vaccine\u2019s effectiveness and efficacy are two different things. Efficacy refers to how well a drug, in this case, a vaccine, works under controlled circumstance such as a clinical trial. Effectiveness refers to how well that drug or vaccine works in the real world. Dr. Matthew Miller, assistant dean at McMaster University\u2019s department of biochemistry and biomedical sciences, said a lower efficacy rate does not always mean a low level of effectiveness in the real world and the same is true for vaccines of high efficacy. He said the efficacy numbers for vaccines tend to be higher than effectiveness due to variables happening in the real world that can\u2019t be accounted for during a clinical trial. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Clinical trials are carefully designed to help mitigate inconsistencies between efficacy and effectiveness, he said. People with underlying health issues or certain types of medication are usually excluded from trials and any side effects found are closely monitored. However, \u201cin practice, we usually see that the effectiveness numbers are modestly lower than the efficacy numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare that you would see a vaccine behave in a way where there\u2019s really high efficacy in a clinical trial, but then much lower effectiveness.\u201d The recently approved AstraZeneca vaccine, for example, showed a 62 and 72 per cent efficacy. This means that 62 per cent and 72 per cent of participants in a vaccinated group saw a reduction in cases in a comparison with the unvaccinated (or placebo) group during their respective trials. This differs from the near 95 per cent effectiveness of mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna. However, all four vaccines authorized for use in Canada \u2014 Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson \u2014   perfect data when it came to preventing death or hospitalization. According to Miller, there is a common misconception that vaccines are always supposed to prevent someone from contracting a disease or virus, but that isn\u2019t necessarily the immediate goal. \u201cA vaccine that might not be great at preventing people from getting symptoms, but might be really good at ensuring that they don\u2019t get severely ill,\u201d he said. Using the AstraZeneca vaccine as an example, Miller noted it may be \u201cmodestly inferior\u201d to mRNA vaccines in its ability to prevent people from getting any symptoms, \u201cbut it\u2019s extraordinarily effective in making sure that even if they do get symptoms, that it\u2019s just a mild illness.\u201d \u201cThe imperative right now is just to ensure that as many people are vaccinated so that they\u2019re immune as soon as possible to reduce the number of severe illnesses and deaths, which is the outcome that we care most about,\u201d he noted. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t According to global health partnership  , the effectiveness of a vaccine is measured in \u201cobservational studies\u201d because \u201cparticipants are not randomly assigned to a treatment versus a placebo group.\u201d On its website, Gavi writes that \u201ccase-control studies assess effectiveness by comparing the vaccination status of individuals who develop the disease (cases) with a group of individuals without the disease (controls) who are also representative of the population from which the cases arise.\u201d \u201cIf the vaccine is effective, the cases are more likely to be the unvaccinated individuals.\u201d Moving into the future, Miller said Canadians can expect to see updated recommendations around if certain people need another booster later on and possibly even a boost with a different vaccine. \u201cThose are all scenarios that are being looked at,\u201d he said."},
{"title": "What Albertans can and can\u2019t do as COVID-19 restrictions ease  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted May 4, 2020 1:57 pm", "body": "Over the weekend, Albertans saw some changes to provincial restrictions regarding the   pandemic. With the hope of slowly reopening the province\u2019s economy,  , which included the opening of golf courses, provincial parks and some non-essential businesses. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t But these changes don\u2019t necessarily mean that life will return to normal for Albertans just yet. As the phased relaunch slowly rolls out, here\u2019s a look at what people can and cannot do across the province amid the pandemic. In short, yes, as long as people are complying with physical distancing regulations and mass gathering restrictions. However, on Friday, Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health,  , stated the while the rules surrounding gatherings are relaxing, visiting family inside their homes can still be risky. Instead, Hinshaw said that people could lower the risk of transmission by arranging to meet outdoors. \u201cIt is currently allowable that up to 15 people gather as long as two metres of distance can be maintained,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cAt this time certainly, as we\u2019re easing cautiously back into interactions, it may be a reduced risk to arrange for outdoor gatherings.\u201d It\u2019s a family decision, Hinshaw said on Friday. She noted that while it\u2019s acceptable for residents to visit their family members in groups of less than 15 people, she added that older populations should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. \u201cPeople can now look at that gathering rule and consider consciously making plans to visit loved ones,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that decision of whether children can visit grandparents is really an individual family decision.\u201d Not if the picnic entails sharing products. While the risk of transmission is lower outdoors, Hinshaw recommended that people should not share food and drink with anyone outside their household. \u201cIt would be my recommendation to not share food or drink in those gatherings, as that seems to be a risk factor for potential transmission.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Craig Jenne, an associate professor with the University of Calgary\u2019s department of microbiology, immunology and infectious diseases, added that while meeting with friends and family is a welcome change to regulations, people need to stay vigilant. \u201cIn social gatherings, we can maintain a physical distance but we can often forget the little things,\u201d Jenne said. \u201cAs we begin to ease restrictions, the public has to keep in mind that this is not a green light to go back to normal.\u201d Organized sports remain off-limits to Albertans due to the inability to adhere to social distancing regulations and avoid commonly-touched surfaces (like a ball or Frisbee, for instance). \n\t\t\t \n\t\t However, on Friday, the City of Calgary announced that the playing of some outdoor sports would be allowed, including singles tennis, singles badminton and singles pickleball \u2014 with slight modifications that ensure players don\u2019t touch the same ball or device during the game. Playgrounds across the province remain closed. As long as social distancing regulations are being followed. Parks and golf courses have now been given the green-light to open across the province, allowing people to utilize Alberta\u2019s green spaces, however, Jenne said residents should do so with caution. \u201cWe should still avoid doing things that aren\u2019t critical to our daily lives,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to keep in mind that as places are more popular, there\u2019s a risk of infection. So just because things are available, that doesn\u2019t mean that everyone should go at the same time.\u201d Jenne added that while regulations may be relaxing across the province, it\u2019s vital that Albertans continue to follow   in the coming weeks just as strictly as they have in the past. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThe reality is that nothing has really changed \u2014 we are no more immune \u2014 so the same physical distancing that has helped flatten the curve is vital to maintain.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t confuse relaxing some requirements with the lack of threat in the community.\u201d"},

On Wednesday, British Columbia   \u2013 first detected in India \u2013 while   in the province. In response to growing concerns, the   on passenger flights from India and Pakistan Thursday. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t While not officially designated as a variant of concern (VOC) by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), B.1.617 is being treated as a \u201cvariant of interest\u201d. And federal health officials say they are closely monitoring it. \u201cWe should be worried,\u201d Donald Vinh, an infectious disease specialist and a medical microbiologist at the McGill University Health Centre, said. \u201cIf a variant can spread into another country, that means it has some capacity for survival fitness and that usually means it\u2019s as or more transmissible than the current strain,\u201d he told Global News. It is natural for all viruses to mutate, as their genetic material undergoes small changes during outbreaks. Biologically, certain mutants give the spike protein \u2014 which is responsible for cell entry \u2014 a higher affinity for the receptor molecule on a healthy cell membrane, meaning the virus latches onto the human cells more effectively. In Canada, as of Thursday,   \u2013 the  , B.1.351 and   \u2013 had been reported across all 10 provinces. Here\u2019s what we know so far about the new B.1.617 variant that has made its way into the country. The B.1.617 variant was initially reported in the Indian state of Maharashtra late last year with two notable mutations \u2013 the E484Q and L452R. The variant is being described as a \u201cdouble mutant\u201d due to a pair of mutations that the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare says  .\u201d It has quickly become the dominant version of the coronavirus in the western state. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Scientists believe the variant is contributing to the  . We\u2019re seeing a cluster of cases in various states and what we are seeing is more and more young people getting severely sick,\u201d said Ananya Banerjee, assistant professor at the school of population and global health at McGill University. The new strain has also been found in several other countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Belgium, Namibia, New Zealand, Singapore and the United States. The E484Q mutation is similar to the E484K mutation found in the B.1.1.7 variant that was first detected in the U.K., the B.1.351 variant, which emerged in South Africa, and the P.1 variant behind Brazil\u2019s deadly COVID-19 surge. Experts say this mutation decreases the ability of antibodies to bind to the spike protein of the virus, making vaccines less effective. The L452R mutation is also present in  , including the fast-spreading B.1.427 and B.1.429 lineage in California. According to the  , monoclonal antibody treatments, which use laboratory-made proteins that mimic our immune system\u2019s ability to fight off the coronavirus, may be less effective against COVID-19 variants with the L452R or E484K substitution in the spike protein. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Vinh said having the L452R mutation will allow the B.1.617 variant to attach better to human cells, making it more transmissible. The L452R mutation has also been associated with weaker neutralization of the virus by convalescent plasma from people who have been infected with the coronavirus,  , professor of public health and microbiology at the University of Cambridge. \u201cHaving two of these mutations, which have been seen in other\u00a0variants around the world, are concerning because there\u2019s a similarity in these mutations that confer increased transmissibility,\u201d Maria Van Kerkhove, COVID-19 technical lead for the World Health Organization (WHO), said during a news conference last Friday. \u201cSome of these mutations also result in reduced neutralization, which may have an impact on our countermeasures, including the vaccines.\u201d The B.1.617 is considered as a \u201cvariant of interest\u201d by the WHO as well as PHAC, meaning that it does not represent cause for stronger public health actions so far. \u201cAt this point, the variants that have been identified in India are more variants of interest, which is not necessarily the same as variants of concern,\u201d Howard Njoo, Canada\u2019s deputy chief public health officer, said during a news conference on Thursday. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe call it a variant of concern when it\u2019s certainly shown to be more transmissible or more virulent, causing severe illness, hospitalization and death. It\u2019s something being looked at very carefully, but at this point, we\u2019re still analyzing the data.\u201d Higher transmissibility of this variant is not established as yet, India\u2019s Health Ministry said  Vinh said it\u2019s not yet clear if the B.1.617 variant would necessarily be more transmissible than the other VOC that are circulating in the country. \u201cIt just seems that it would be more contagious than the strain that we had before these variants.\u201d In an emailed statement to Global News, Anna Maddison, PHAC spokesperson, said: \u201cAt this time, there is insufficient evidence to determine if B.1.617 behaves significantly differently than the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has been predominant in Canada during the earlier phases of the pandemic, although evaluations are underway both in Canada and internationally.\u201d The person who tested positive for the B.1.617 variant in Quebec had been vaccinated against COVID-19, according to Quebec\u2019s public health institute (INSPQ). The presence of the E484Q mutation \u201cthreatens to decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine,\u201d said Vinh. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t But there is also a \u201cglimmer of hope,\u201d he added, from the experience of Israel, which has fully vaccinated around 81 per cent of citizens or residents over the age of 16. \u201cThe impression is that Pfizer vaccine has efficacy against it, albeit a reduced efficacy,\u201d  , adding that the number of cases of the B.1.617 variant in Israel stood at eight. Gigi Gronvall, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, also allayed concerns about vaccine effectiveness. \u201cNone of the variants that we have encountered so far seem to evade the vaccines that we have available,\u201d she told Global News. \u201cThankfully, the vaccines that we have stimulate quite a lot of antibodies to respond, so some changes in the virus are outmatched by the antibody levels that are produced. \u201cAnd also, we\u2019re not just relying on antibodies. There\u2019s other parts of the immune system, too.\u201d"},

The B.C. government is scheduled on Tuesday to release the much-anticipated details of the plan which is expected to outline when British Columbia can start holding events or attending indoor social gatherings. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, Premier John Horgan, Economic Recovery Minister Ravi Kahlon and Health Minister Adrian Dix are set to announce the details at 1 p.m. Global BC will carry the press conference live here, on the   and on BC1. The plan is expected to include details on when people will be encouraged to travel within their communities and around the province. Charles Horn from Pedaler Cycling Tours in Victoria says Victoria Day long weekend often marks the start of the peak summer season. He says the pandemic has meant an 80 per cent drop in business due to a closure of the US/Canada board and a lack of domestic travellers. \u201cWhat I am really hoping for is some clarity over what can happen in the next 60 to 90 days so people can book. If they can\u2019t plan, they don\u2019t book and that means they don\u2019t come,\u201d Horn said. \u201cWhat I need to be able to see is people can plan ahead. They can say maybe I can\u2019t come this week but I know when I can come. It doesn\u2019t all have to happen at once, but if people can have some clarity then we are back on track.\u201d Ontario and Saskatchewan have outlined re-opening plans including benchmarks based on vaccination. Henry has mentioned British Columbia\u2019s plan is going to look not just at vaccination levels but also at hospital pressure and current COVID case numbers. So far 2,738,244 adult British Columbians have received at least one dose of the vaccine, about 65 per cent of the adult population. The province hopes to get past 80 per cent by mid-June. The province is expected to re-open in-person restaurant dining on Tuesday but most of the other restrictions will be eased over time. Rickshaw Theatre owner Mo Tarmohamed says he has not been able to hold a concert in more than 14 months and cannot operate with anything below 75 per cent capacity. He is hoping the province will outline a plan for when people can attend concerts without social distancing guidelines in place. \u201cI have lots of shows on the books now for October, November but I can\u2019t pull the trigger until we know for certainty and the longer we wait, this is about the deadline, I have to know by now or those shows will go away,\u201d Tarmohamed said. \u201cIt has to be at least 75 to 100 per cent capacity. Anything below that is not worth doing. What I am expecting is we will get a measured approach to this. Fifty person capacity does nothing for me, I can\u2019t open with that.\u201d Adult and youth recreational sports are hoping to hear good news on Tuesday. They have not been allowed to play games since November. Urban Rec founder Chris McNally says they average about 10,000 adults a year participating in rec sports leagues in the province. \u201cI really think it is about clear guidelines and clear timelines we can plan around. We have been waiting to go and for us, we could press a button and be ready to go in 24 hours. We have hired staff for the spring season,\u201d McNally said. \u201cAll we want to do is do it right and do it as quick as we can.\u201d"},
{"title": "Majority of COVID-19 infections, deaths now among unvaccinated people in Canada: Data - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted June 25, 2021 8:22 pm", "body": "A majority of Canada\u2019s   infections and fatalities are now occurring in people who were not vaccinated against the disease, according to newly-released data from the country\u2019s public health agency. Data from the Public Health Agency of Canada found that, as of June 21, the country\u2019s \u201cbreakthrough\u201d infections in fully vaccinated people accounted for just over 2,700 cases \u2014 about 0.5 per cent \u2014 of all reported infections from 10 provinces and territories since the vaccine rollout started. Of those fully vaccinated infections, only 66 of those cases died due to COVID-19, compared to the estimated 13,000 deaths that occurred across the country since the start of the rollout in December. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The vaccine\u2019s effectiveness, even for those who were partially vaccinated, was evident, according to the data. There was a total of 24,469 partially vaccinated COVID-19 cases, which accounted for 4 per cent of all infections since the first vaccines started being administered in Canada. Again, severe outcomes from contracting COVID-19\u00a0 \u2014 including death \u2014 were heavily reduced with just one shot, with 484 or 2 per cent of those partially vaccinated infections having died due to the virus. A statement from PHAC sent to Global News on Friday said that patients with COVID-19 after either receiving one or two doses were less likely to die than unvaccinated cases that were reported. \u201cThe protective effect was significant among partially vaccinated cases aged 60+ years and those that occurred after vaccination with 2 doses over 80 years of age,\u201d read the statement. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cOf the vaccinated individuals, only 0.0027 per cent died due to COVID-19 while partially vaccinated and 0.0018 per cent died due to COVID-19 while fully vaccinated\u201d The PHAC data also found that by June 21, only 0.14 per cent of partially vaccinated people were infected 14 days or more after their first dose, while 0.08 per cent of fully vaccinated people became were infected seven or more days after their second. The data comes as Canada continues to place among the most vaccinated countries in the world, currently averaging over 460,000 vaccine doses doled out per day according to  . To date, over 76 per cent of all eligible Canadians aged 12 and over have received at least one dose of the vaccine and more than 27 per cent of those eligible have received their full two doses. The continued vaccine uptick comes paired with further declining new cases, deaths and hospitalizations across the country, with Canada\u2019s average new cases of COVID-19 averaging over 600 a day \u2014 a number that hasn\u2019t been seen since early September of last year. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The promising data on severe outcomes, or rather the lack thereof, for those who were vaccinated was also released alongside new guidelines from the public health agency. Several dos and don\u2019ts for Canadians who have received either one or two doses of the vaccine were included in an infographic Friday. Those who have received both doses would no longer have to wear masks or physically distance when outside with small groups of people from several households, even if those people are unvaccinated. Those wanting to do the same, such as attending events, having dinner or even giving hugs in an indoor setting, would have to do so with other fully vaccinated people. Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada\u2019s deputy chief public health officer, said during a press conference that the guidelines differed significantly than the ones previously outlined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, despite some similarities. \u201cThe CDC guidance, it makes it seem straightforward: \u2018Yes, I have made two vaccines. I can do whatever I want,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re saying, \u2018No, it\u2019s much more nuanced than that.'\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Despite both the updated guidelines and vaccine data, public health officials continued to caution provinces with their reopening plans amid the spread of the Delta COVID-19 variant. According to PHAC\u2019s most recent COVID-19 epidemiology and modelling released on Friday, the variant could see an even \u201cgreater than previously expected resurgence\u201d of the virus this fall and winter should vaccination coverage not be high enough. Njoo also pointed out that the guidelines were made with the experiences of several countries now dealing with Delta in mind, specifically that of the U.K. and Israel. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Both of those countries had good vaccination rates and programs, but were forced to reimplement measures or push back reopening due to the spread of the variant. \u201cSo I think all these experiences in other countries also inform us here in Canada as a sort of cautionary tale,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would say, hey, you know, the science keeps evolving. We\u2019ll have to keep an eye on the various and certainly learn from other countries as well as we move forward.\u201d"},
{"title": "Canadian researchers find COVID-19 antibodies last for months, likely years - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted January 21, 2021 7:00 am", "body": "Hart Jackson\u2019s colleagues at Sinai Health in Toronto have affectionately nicknamed him \u2018the human pincushion.\u2019 For months now, Jackson has been routinely pricking his finger to provide blood samples, in hopes of helping to answer a central question in the fight against  : How long does immunity last? And so far, the findings appear promising. \u201cFrom all indications, I think there is a good chance that it can be longer lasting,\u201d he said. Jackson is an investigator at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute (LTRI) at Mount Sinai Hospital, specializing in breast cancer research. After completing his training in Switzerland, Jackson moved home to Toronto in March 2020, just as the first wave of COVID-19 was crashing into Canada. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Upon arrival, he, his partner and their infant son quarantined at home as a precaution \u2014 and they\u2019re grateful that they did. \u201cAt about day five (of our quarantine), my partner developed a dry cough. And then it all started, where we all had slight fevers and coughs, including our six-month-old,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe got the (COVID-19 test) results back very fast, which were positive and shocked all of us.\u201d Following his recovery in April, Jackson heard that some of his colleagues at Sinai Health and the University of Toronto were developing an antibody test to investigate whether patients who\u2019d previously been sick with COVID-19 were immune to re-infection. \u201cAs soon as the trial started, I was signing up right away and hoping to get involved and provide any samples that I can,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time, it wasn\u2019t known how long this (immunity) was going to last.\u201d But now 10 months since he became infected with COVID-19, Jackson\u2019s antibodies remain robust. And COVID-19 researchers are growing increasingly optimistic that immunity \u2014 whether acquired through infection or vaccination \u2014 will endure for some time. \u201cWe know several people that were infected back in February and they still have quite a bit of antibodies,\u201d said Anne-Claude Gingras, a biochemist and senior investigator at the LTRI,\u00a0who developed one of the earliest COVID-19 antibodies tests. \u201cThe neutralizing antibodies decline a little bit, but they decline very, very slowly.\u201d Gingras points to SARS as an example of another coronavirus that can result in long-lasting immunity. \u201cWe have at least one person, the only person whose blood we have access to, who is still walking around with a fairly high level of antibodies to SARS-CoV-1, that were acquired presumably in 2003.\u201d Recent studies suggest the level of antibodies from COVID-19 peak after around four weeks, but  (the period for which data on the new coronavirus is available).  found that even relatively low antibody counts were sufficient for protection against re-infection. \u201cBased on the decay curves to those immune responses, we can extrapolate that immunity to the virus should last a number of years, at least to the viral variant that one was exposed to. So that\u2019s great news,\u201d said Jennifer Gommerman, an immunologist at the University of Toronto\u2019s Temerty Faculty of Medicine. The findings are fuelling calls for greater freedoms for the more than 600,000 Canadians who have recovered from COVID-19, particularly in compassionate cases. Jackson\u2019s grandmother was living in a long-term care home in Toronto last fall when she became infected and later died from COVID-19. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Despite Jackson\u2019s test results showing he had COVID-19 antibodies, he was not allowed to visit. \u201cIt was difficult, as my family wasn\u2019t able to see her much before, because the care home was on lockdown,\u201d he said. \u201cThe thought was, maybe I can go to the long term care home and help out, as I might be at a lower risk myself. But we\u2019re at a stage where the rules still apply to everyone. I\u2019m in a very rare situation.\u201d Some countries, though, are now rewriting those rules and adopting so-called \u2018immunity passport\u2019 systems for the growing number who have recovered from COVID-19. Hungary and Iceland, for example, are offering quarantine-free entry to foreigners who can prove that they\u2019ve already had COVID-19. But Gingras and her colleagues caution that a recovered COVID-19 patient\u2019s natural immunity can vary, particularly in those who suffered only minor symptoms. \u201cDifferent people that have different symptoms\u2019 severity have different levels of antibodies,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question will be: the people that didn\u2019t have bad symptoms, will their antibodies fall faster?\u201d Already, a small number of patients have . For that reason, Gommerman recommends that those who\u2019ve recovered from COVID-19 should receive the vaccine regardless. \u201cNow, I would suggest that those people may be not be at the front of the line for getting the vaccine, because they do have immune memory to the virus. But it won\u2019t hurt to get the vaccine,\u201d she said, noting that the strength of a person\u2019s natural immunity may depend on their initial exposure to the virus or \u2018viral load.\u2019 \u201cWhen you\u2019re in an elevator and you\u2019re getting exposed to the virus, you could be getting a really big dose,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re getting the vaccine, you\u2019re getting it in a prescribed dose in a way that tricks the immune system to respond appropriately. Because we\u2019re giving the same dose to everyone, the playing field is level.\u201d It\u2019s less clear at this stage how long immunity derived from COVID-19 vaccines will last, but some early evidence appears promising. A   found volunteers who\u2019d received the Moderna vaccine had similar levels of antibodies after four months to those who had been infected with COVID-19. Whether the leading vaccines will prove as effective against the new virus variants first identified in South Africa and the United Kingdom\u00a0 . \u201cThe longer we wait to vaccinate the population, the more likely it is that new variants will emerge,\u201d Gommerman warned. \u201cWe\u2019re in a bit of a race against time and the sooner we achieve herd immunity, the better.\u201d"},

Many people young and old rely on reading lips as they go about their daily lives and masks make that impossible. Face coverings are required in more locations and health experts say they can reduce your risk of contracting the novel coronavirus if you come in contact with someone who is infected. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Kingdon and many other advocates understand how important masks are in the fight against the spread of   but they want greater public awareness to help those who are deaf or have hearing loss. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to advocate with the health minister in Canada to talk about these issues and promote the practice of wearing clear masks as a standard approach where applicable,\u201d Kingdon said. A similar push is underway in the United Kingdom where it is estimated 12 million people are deaf or hard of hearing. On July 31, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced masks would be required in more locations, including museums and cinemas, starting Aug. 8. The pandemic has revealed long-standing challenges for those who are deaf or have hearing loss. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In May, two deaf doctors shared their experiences in an issue of the  , highlighting the lack of clear face coverings approved for the medical setting. Kingdon lost her hearing as a young adult. In 2005, she had surgery to have a cochlear implant inserted in her right ear but she still reads lips. She described how a recently scheduled appointment to see her optometrist was filled with \u201cdread\u201d because she had to wear her mask and knew they would also have their faces covered for protection against the virus. \u201cI was wearing my mask and when I walked through the door, I saw they had clear face shields and instantly it was a different story. I just knew I would be able to make it work and not struggle to understand what they were saying,\u201d Kingdon said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Many individuals or businesses may not realize how a mask may hinder someone\u2019s ability to shop or travel or access health care when they have hidden disabilities. \u201cThere\u2019s been so many issues come through those of us with hearing loss and it\u2019s created just not communication issues but very much mental health issues. There is a lot of angst. There is a lot of frustration. There is a lot of fear,\u201d Kingdon said. There are many apps for mobile phones that can assist in communication or questions can be written down, but you have to be able to recognize that someone is struggling. Advocates say those with hearing loss will often touch their ears or try to use their hands in some way to show that they don\u2019t understand or are having trouble communicating."},

It is a busy afternoon in the ICU at Scarborough General Hospital.\u00a0There are 37 beds, with nine  patients to care for. These are the most critical of the COVID-19 patients in the hospital. The team is accustomed to a high-stress environment, but working through this pandemic is unlike any experience these front-line health-care workers have had in the past. \u201cWe\u2019re right there at the greatest risks \u2026 what the public sees through the camera is not necessarily what goes on here,\u201d explained respiratory therapist Kelly Cray. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cIt\u2019s tiring, frustrating not being able to succeed in getting your patient past their illness.\u201d Cray was pulled to the front lines at the start of the pandemic a year ago. \u201cIt\u2019s been up and down \u2026 when COVID started, my outpatient clinic was shut down so I was brought back into critical care \u2014 it was a change in my home life and at work,\u201d she said. Dr. Ilan Fischler, chief of psychiatry for Scarborough Health Network, pointed to research suggesting, \u201cabout 75 to 80 percent of physicians in North America are experiencing burnout. The vaccine is giving everyone hope that there is a light at the end of the tunnel but there\u2019s still the fear about the third wave.\u201d For Dr. Martin Betts, chief of critical care, there is a constant worry about his team\u2019s mental health. \u201cThe last year has been a really challenging year for myself and our all health-care providers,\u201d Betts said. \u201cChallenging because of the duration of the pandemic, challenging because when we go home like for everyone else life is not normal \u2026 but mostly because of the needs of our patients and how sick patients are.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Betts is aware burnout could be an issue as the pandemic rolls into a second year, and so he encourages his staff to talk about it and to look out for one another. \u201cThe challenge with burnout is that it\u2019s often under the covers and not really apparent. So we really have to rely on each other to recognize the signs in one another and help support each other that way,\u201d he said. It doesn\u2019t help that the usual means of support are lost to COVID-19 safety protocols \u2014 a simple gesture, like a hug from a colleague, is not possible. \u201cWe are not hugging each other anymore and we always have to have a mask \u2026 we are trying our very best to just support each other verbally, at least, if not by hugging,\u201d said patient care coordinator Ann Li. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Dr. Julie Ann Irving, a Toronto clinical psychologist who specializes in physician wellness, explained \u201cBurnout is thought to be a precursor in some cases for depression or generalized anxiety that shares some of the features and so if we leave it unaddressed it can get worse and it can be harder to treat.\u201d At this stage, Dr. Irving said physicians may not have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, but that does not mean they aren\u2019t experiencing some of the symptoms. \u201cNot sleeping as well, feeling chronically anxious, having difficulty turning their flight or fight system off,\u201d she said. Social worker Hayley Harlock is the founder of \u201cThe Flipside Life\u201d \u2014 an online support group for physician families. \u201cThere\u2019s statistics that talk about how over 85 per cent of physicians may know that supports exist for them but less than 15 per cent are actually seeking out the support,\u201d she said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Harlock, whose husband is a surgeon in Hamilton, Ont., is advocating to include families in the conversation surrounding mental health. \u201cIf we included physician families as a partner and as part of the team, then there\u2019s a lot of room to educate families about what to look at \u2026 if your spouse is telling you \u2018I\u2019m fine\u2019 you might not know what the next step might be,\u201d she said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Back in the ICU at Scarborough General Hospital, amid a flurry of physicians and nurses, a woman is pushing a cart filled with treats and chatting animatedly with the staff. \u201cAre you ready? Are you ready?\u201d asks wellness coordinator Philippa Dawood, adding enthusiastically, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get going!\u201d Then suddenly, she turns on music.\u00a0It is loud and everyone quickly gathers, giggling and shouting. For about ten minutes, the whole team is following Dawood\u2019s choreography and the mood has shifted.\u00a0There is joy and laughter, in stark contrast to the pain and suffering that surrounds them. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe work under a lot of stress in here so when Philippa comes and helps us de-stress \u2026 that little moment where we\u2019re not thinking about the patient helps us get through the day,\u201d said Li. \u201cFrom the very beginning when the pandemic hit, our senior leadership recognized the importance of wellness in this organization explained Dawood. \u201cStaff are not alone and it\u2019s OK to not be OK. To have that communication and to have the ability to provide staff a break has really had a very positive impact on the team for the past year.\u201d Dawood visits all three sites, bringing her cart, music and positive attitude. Mental health is not a bad word. We want people to open up and to share and to feel comfortable asking for help. And I will give physical activity. I will give peer support. I\u2019m not a therapist or counselor, but my role is to share information, to listen, to provide them the tools and resources that they need,\u201d she said. It is clear the team appreciates her efforts. \u201cResilience is a challenge. Burnout is real. And what I\u2019d like to offer in wellness is a chance to take a break and reflect, to laugh.\u201d"},

She was expecting her daughter, who lives in the United States, to visit last month but the   pandemic put a stop to that. Seeing Suzi on Facetime is the next best thing for Cohavi. \u201cWe implemented the face-to-family program through the iPad and now with COVID-19 happening we need family members to be in contact with their loved ones and so this is a chance for them to get to see their family member face to face and be able to talk to them,\u201d said Kayla Johnston, manager of programs and volunteer services at The Rekai Centres. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t There was an outbreak of COVID-19 at one of The Rekai Centres\u2019 facilities recently and a resident died of the virus. Dozens of long-term care homes around Ontario have reported cases of COVID-19, including the Pinecrest Nursing Home in Bobcaygeon where more than 20 patients have died of the virus so far. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing with the older population, in your 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, your death rate goes from three to eight to 15 to 24 per cent and in fact people in nursing homes if they get it, they\u2019re reporting death rates of 33 per cent,\u201d explained Dr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at the Sinai Health System. He said older adults are more vulnerable to serious complications from the virus because of their weakened immune systems. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. The patients I care for every day, they\u2019re in the line of fire. They\u2019ve got a greater risk of dying,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they scared? Absolutely. Are they more isolated from everybody else in society right now? Absolutely because we\u2019re telling them to do that and we\u2019re not allowing them the interactions with the grandkids.\u201d Next week, Dr. Sinha will volunteer his services at three downtown Toronto hospitals for older patients in distress who may require his specialist expertise. He told Global News that is when he is expecting the hospitals to begin to fill. It has been particularly hard on Dr. Sinha as he is passionate about caring and advocating for his elderly patients. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to see a population that is being so predominantly victimized by this particular illness and it\u2019s also sad to think that we may not have enough resources to support all of them and that really starts to weigh on you,\u201d he said. Another factor that concerns Dr. Sinha is the number of ventilators available in Ontario. \u201cWe are genuinely worried that we may not have enough for everybody because we may not have gotten a good enough handle on COVID and we have more people infected than we actually know,\u201d he noted. This means he may need to have difficult conversations with his patients and their family members. \u201cNo physician ever wants to be in a situation, I don\u2019t think any society or any family ever wants to be in a position where they have to have the conversation of who gets a ventilator and who doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said.  \u201cA lot of my patients would argue that they have actually paid the most taxes out of all of us over time, and probably they\u2019ve actually built the hospital that I\u2019m working at with their tax dollars and they\u2019ve probably paid for most of the vents that we\u2019re using now too and so why shouldn\u2019t they get their access?\u201d Laura Tamblyn Watts, an advocate for seniors, pointed to tragedies in nursing homes across the country and predicted there will be more. \u201cIt is critically important that long-term care be given the same priorities as other types of health care settings, like acute care in hospitals. We are desperate in the long-term care sector to get the personal protective equipment and the testing that we need,\u201d she said. Tamblyn Watts said she expects the death toll in long-term care due to COVID-19 may currently be higher than what has been reported. \u201cI can assure you it\u2019s much greater than that because we are doing very little testing so anyone who has COVID-19 in long-term care can be assumed it has spread to those around them as well,\u201d she added. Tamblyn Watts also pointed out it\u2019s important to keep seniors\u2019 spirits up during this time of physical distancing. She encouraged window visits at long-term care facilities, video calls, such as Facetime and Skype, and creative programming to keep residents engaged. For Edith Cohavi, who has not seen her daughter in several months and may not for several more, her chats on Facetime, thanks to the staff at Wellesley Central Place, are filling the void for now."},

How many cases are really out there? It\u2019s impossible to tell since not everybody who may have the virus gets tested and  . \u00a0 Here are the known cases so far. When you look at their share of the population, Canadians between 50 and 70 appear to be more likely to have been diagnosed with the disease and those under 19 much less likely. (In Italy, the elderly have made up the  .) \n\t\t\t \n\t\t There are two cautions with the data, though. One is that we have age data for roughly half of the Canadians with a COVID-19 diagnosis. The other is that many people with no reason to seek out medical attention turn out to be carrying the virus. In Iceland, which is testing on an ambitious scale, about  . Here is an age breakdown of cases for which we know the age, along with their proportion of the overall population: Here is a graph of high-population provinces. In recent days, Quebec has had Canada\u2019s highest rate of positive tests. Here\u2019s another look at the same data, this time expressed as a rate per 100,000. Quebec still has far more cases in relation to its population, but Ontario, B.C. and Alberta look much more similar to each other. Here\u2019s what it looks like if you adjust for population differences: \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u00a0 \u00a0 Something else to bear in mind, though, is that provinces and territories test at very different rates. As Iceland found, the more you test, the more you find. Something else to keep an eye on is the percentage of tests that come back positive. The World Health Organization said this week that places where most tests come back positive are doing a poor job of keeping track of the virus, and  . The WHO likes to see positive rates around 10-12 per cent, which it sees as a sign of vigilance. The good news is that every Canadian jurisdiction is doing better than that. However, a look at the positive rates of tests conducted shows where the stresses on the testing system are. Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec lead the country, followed some distance back by Ontario. Ontario has increased its testing in recent days. Further down the list are the Western provinces, followed by the territories, which have been testing much more aggressively than communities in the south.

Kenney, in a live address on TV, social media and the United Conservative government\u2019s website, said the next three weeks are critical and that potential catastrophe awaits. Some of the rules take effect immediately, while others will kick in at the end of this weekend. \u201cThese stepped-up measures will take effect province-wide, with the exception of a few communities that have very low levels of spread,\u201d Kenney told Albertans. \u201cOur province has entered a critical stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cWe have set case records. What\u2019s more concerning, we have also set a record for the number of Albertans with COVID(-19) in intensive care.\u201d The provincial government said municipalities or areas with less than 50 cases per 100,000 people and with less than 30 active cases will be exempt from the restrictions. On Wednesday, Alberta Health clarified that   will still take effect in the entire province. Among the new measures being implemented are that, effective Friday, all students from kindergarten to Grade 12 will temporarily move to at-home learning until May 25. Students with disabilities who need to continue to attend classes in-person will be exempt from the rules. Many of Alberta\u2019s schools have already moved online. Post-secondary classes will also all be moved online. Businesses will also be affected by the restrictions. Kenney announced that capacity at retail shops will be reduced to no more than 10 per cent of customer capacity. Starting Sunday at midnight, restaurants and bars will no longer be allowed to keep patios open, and can only offer take-out and delivery. Also, personal services like hair salons, tattoo studios, tanning salons and nail salons will be forced to close for three weeks. The premier announced attendance at places of worship will be capped at 15 people \u2014 instead of 15 per cent capacity \u2014 while the maximum attendance at funerals will be reduced to 10 people. The maximum number of people allowed at outdoor gatherings will be lowered from 10 to five, while Kenney added \u201ca strong recommendation\u201d that people limit their gatherings to two family cohorts. \u201cOutdoor sports and recreation will be limited to household and close contacts only,\u201d Kenney added. \u201cAnd youth and adult performance will close.\u201d \u201cI know this is all discouraging to hear,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cNobody wants to be here \u2014 especially after 14 months and multiple waves of this pandemic. \u201cBut our commitment to the health and safety of Albertans must come first. \u201cThe good news is we have vaccines on our side. They are already working wonders and they are finally arriving in larger and larger numbers.\u201d Opposition Leader Rachel Notley held a news conference shortly after Kenney spoke and said his address left her with a number of questions, specifically about parts of the province that would be exempt from the new restrictions. \u201cHe needs to give us more information: where are these (restrictions)? Where are they not?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy is there a difference? Is it just defined by UCP MLAs? And how long will this last? \u201cBecause quite honestly, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a person out there that thinks two weeks is going to do the trick.\u201d The premier\u2019s address did not provide an opportunity for reporters to ask questions \u2014 something Notley disagreed with. She added she was disappointed Kenney did not bring up the issue of providing more Albertans with the opportunity to receive paid sick leave, something she said medical experts have argued could significantly help to slow the spread of COVID-19. \u201cI fear so many\u2026 (workers) will, as a result, be forced to choose between staying home to prevent transmission and paying their bills,\u201d Notley said. \u201cScientists in Ontario have suggested that provision of sick pay could drop infection rates by 50 per cent. But today there was no mention of that from Jason Kenney at all. \u201cFor people to follow the rules, the government must step up and provide adequate financial support to the small businesses that are being jeopardized by these last-minute decisions,\u201d she added. Notley also called on the premier \u201cto immediately establish an Alberta learn-from-home fund to support families as students move online again.\u201d Kenney is scheduled to attend a news conference Wednesday morning alongside Health Minister Tyler Shandro, Justice Minister Kaycee Madu, Education Minister Adriana LaGrange and chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw to go over the new public health restrictions in greater detail. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Kenney announced the new restrictions Tuesday despite over a dozen members of his own government formally criticizing his use of public health restrictions to battle COVID-19. The premier reiterated to Albertans that his government continues to try to balance protecting \u201cboth lives and livelihoods throughout this pandemic.\u201d \u201cThis has meant resisting pressure to implement widespread lockdown policies \u2014 recognizing their severe impact on peoples\u2019 lives,\u201d he said. \u201cGovernments must not impair peoples\u2019 rights or their livelihoods unless it is absolutely necessary to save lives, and in this case, to prevent a disaster from unfolding in our hospitals. \u201cUnfortunately, that is the situation we are facing today.\u201d Kenney said even though most Albertans over 50 have had a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine already, the novel coronavirus continues to spread \u201cat an alarming rate \u2014 especially amongst younger people.\u201d \u201cThat is why we must act now to stop the spike,\u201d he said. \u201cIf exponential growth of COVID-19 in Alberta continues, it would begin to push the outer limits of our hospital capacity within weeks.\u201d Kenney said there are currently 226 Albertans in ICUs across the province, 150 of them because of COVID-19. \u201cThat\u2019s far more than the total number of ICU beds that we would have available in a typical year,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cif pressed,\u201d the province has the ability to open up to 425 ICU beds. However, doing so would require \u201cmass cancellations of surgeries and other care,\u201d the premier noted. Kenney has repeatedly said recently that one of the biggest hurdles to getting COVID-19 under control in Alberta has been that too many people do not adhere to the public health restrictions already in place. On Tuesday, he announced his government would be \u201cdoubling the basic fine for violating public health orders from $1,000 to $2,000.\u201d \u201cAnd we are introducing a tougher enforcement protocol for repeat offenders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not tolerate those who endanger the health of their fellow Albertans while the vast majority of people are doing the right thing.\u201d During a news conference about Alberta\u2019s COVID-19 situation on Monday, Kenney said he expected to announce stronger restrictions soon. On Tuesday, Alberta confirmed an additional 1,743 cases of COVID-19 as well as 876 new cases involving variants of concern. Variants of concern now make up at least 62.3 per cent of active cases. Alberta Health Services has shifted away from screening all positive COVID-19 cases for variants of concern, instead targeting variant screening on populations at highest risk. Nine more deaths due to COVID-19 were announced Tuesday. Three of the deaths were reported from the Edmonton zone with comorbidities: a man in his 60s and a man in his 90s died. Another 60-year-old man with no known comorbidities also died in that zone. In the Calgary zone, four deaths were reported and all had comorbidities: a man in his 80s, two men in their 70s and a man in his 60s. A 60-year-old man with no known comorbidities in the Central zone died and a woman in her 80s with known comorbidities in the South zone also died. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Alberta\u2019s COVID-19 death toll now stands at 2,099. There were 671 Albertans hospitalized with COVID-19, with 150 of those people in the ICU. \u201cTake this seriously,\u201d Kenney implored Albertans on Monday, as he suggested the health-care system could soon see its capacity overwhelmed if the province\u2019s rise in coronavirus cases does not begin to flatten or decline. Kenney said the conversation around possible restrictions was ongoing, but did not say on Monday what they would entail, but has repeatedly said \u201clockdowns\u201d similar to what Toronto has done haven\u2019t had the desired effect. \u201cWe can have, on paper, the hardest lockdown imaginable, and if\u2026 a large share of the population isn\u2019t following that, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. As well as the new cases announced on Monday, the province also confirmed an additional four COVID-related deaths. An additional 1,900 variants of concern were also identified, making up at least 63.8 per cent of active cases. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Alberta Health Services has shifted away from screening all positive COVID-19 cases for variants of concern, instead targeting variant screening on populations at highest risk. As of Monday\u2019s update, there were 23,608 active cases of COVID-19 in the province. To date, 171,212 Albertans have recovered from COVID-19."},

We are in a data-free, evidence-free zone as far as mix and match,\u201d Soumya Swaminathan told an online briefing. \u201cIt will be a chaotic situation in countries if citizens start deciding when and\u00a0who\u00a0will be taking a second, a third and a fourth dose.\u201d Swaminathan later clarified her remarks on Twitter, saying people should follow public health advice and not make their own decisions on vaccine mixing or taking additional doses. She said public health agencies can provide advice based on available data, but added that studies on mixing various vaccines are ongoing and that \u201cimmunogenicity and safety both need to be evaluated.\u201d Individuals should not decide for themselves, public health agencies can, based on available data. Data from mix and match studies of different vaccines are awaited \u2013 immunogenicity and safety both need to be evaluated  \u2014 Soumya Swaminathan (@doctorsoumya)  \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Canada is one of several countries that has been mixing and matching approved vaccines. In June, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) said people who received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine should get an mRNA vaccine \u2014 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna \u2014 for their second dose, unless contraindicated. The vaccines can be safely mixed and matched in most scenarios, they said. Canadian experts have largely sided with the national agency, recognizing the practice as safe. NACI also promoted the mixture of mRNA vaccines, saying those vaccines can be interchangeable if the same product was not readily available for the second dose. That strategy was used in late June in Ontario, when officials promoted the use of Moderna\u2019s vaccine for second doses due to a shortage of Pfizer-BioNTech in the province. Other provinces also took on the recommendation. The non-binding recommendations were based on a range of factors \u2014 from safety concerns to vaccine supply, said Theresa Tam, Canada\u2019s chief public health officer, during a news conference on June 1. \u201cThe interchangeability of vaccines means that you can receive one vaccine product for your first dose and then safely receive a different vaccine for your second dose to complete your two-dose vaccine series for optimal protection from COVID-19,\u201d Tam said. \u201cThis advice provides provinces and territories with effective options to manage their vaccine programs,\u201d she added. We see data from the UK, Spain & Germany demonstrating that mixing vaccines (in the manner we are doing in Canada) is safe & provides a significant/robust immune response. \u2014 Isaac Bogoch (@BogochIsaac)  Leading up to the recommendations, Canadian health officials were awaiting studies from Europe that were exploring the mixture of vaccines. Preliminary results from a University of Oxford study published on May 12 found that mixing the Pfizer-BioNtech and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines may increase the frequency of mild to moderate side effects. But these symptoms were short-lived \u2014 lasting no longer than a few days \u2014 and there were no hospitalizations or other safety concerns. Health experts have also stressed in the wake of Swaminathan\u2019s comments that available data shows mixing vaccines is safe and effective, providing a significant immune response against COVID-19. I think the notion was more around citizens going and getting many different doses of different vaccines \u2013 outside of public health.  She did comment that AZ/Pfizer does have data (and so should AZ/mRNA on that). \u2014 Zain Chagla (@zchagla)  \u2014 "},

{"title": "COVID-19 immunity? Ottawa researchers to test long-term potency of coronavirus immune response - Ottawa | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted October 16, 2020 12:45 pm", "body": "Researchers in Ottawa are embarking on a 10-month study to answer critical questions about how individual immune system responses to the novel   differ and how soon after infection a patient might be at risk again. The team\u2019s findings could have major implications for   research and help to predict an individual\u2019s risk of developing serious complications related to  , but one of the study\u2019s lead researchers warns the findings won\u2019t lead to any ironclad declarations of COVID immunity among recovered patients. A team of researchers with the University of Ottawa and The Ottawa Hospital will study COVID-19 antibody and T cell responses from 1,000 subjects over the next 10 months. In an infection, T cells target infected cells and help to stimulate B cells, which then produce antibodies to neutralize pathogens and label them for disruption. Half of the study participants will be people who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, while the other half will be a surveillance cohort of front-line workers and other people who would have a high risk of exposure to the virus but might not have been tested for infection. The goal will be to test how long these subjects\u2019 immune systems produce antibodies capable of neutralizing the pathogen after the initial infection. Dr. Marc-Andr\u00e9 Langlois, professor with the University of Ottawa\u2019s Faculty of Medicine, tells Global News the study idea was first proposed in the spring to answer an integral question in combating the novel coronavirus pandemic. \u201cSince the very beginning of the epidemic, we were quite sure everyone who is infected will make antibodies, but how long will those antibodies last and how long will that protection last?\u201d The question of COVID immunity has been in the spotlight in recent weeks, with U.S. President Donald Trump proclaiming to be immune to COVID-19 after testing positive and subsequently recovering from the virus. Health experts have said Trump\u2019s messaging, which has included assertions that others who tested positive for the coronavirus are also immune,   Recent examples of   for the virus are also throwing those claims into doubt. Langlois says Trump is a \u201ccomplicated case\u201d because of the experimental treatment he was given, which saw him treated with external antibodies rather than just developing them on his own. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Typically, an infected individual\u2019s immune response will develop its own antibodies and T cells \u2014 the immune system\u2019s one-two punch \u2014 to combat the pathogen. T cells and B cells can then form a memory of sorts that recognizes familiar pathogens and triggers a stronger response the next time a similar virus enters the immune system. \u201cThe basis of long-term immunity is having these sentinels that remain in your lymph nodes and your bone marrow so that if you\u2019re re-exposed to the pathogen, you will be able to produce a fresh lot of antibodies on your own. These will be produced by your own cells and these will protect you,\u201d Langlois explains. \u201cIn the case of Trump, those antibodies came from an outside source and neutralized the virus. It is unknown if he has any memory B cells or memory T cells,\u201d he says. But even in a typical immune response scenario, which can include an internal response triggered by an external vaccine, memory cells tend to fade after a period of time. Because of the natural waning immunity to these antigens, vaccinations often require booster shots to restimulate the immune response for the long-term. One of the most integral takeaways from the upcoming research, then, will be establishing the window of time when a booster would be needed for anyone receiving the upcoming COVID-19 vaccines so that the immunization sticks. The convalescent cohort \u2014 those who have had lab-confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus \u2014 will be monitored over the next 10 months for their levels of neutralizing antibodies to help determine when the post-recovery immunity typically fades. The other 500 participants who were at high risk of exposure but did not get a positive test will be tracked for their own immune responses. Researchers are betting that a portion of the group, maybe five to 10 per cent, might have been infected early on in the pandemic and shown no or mild symptoms, making their immune responses especially important for determining what gives an individual more effective protection against the virus. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to monitor and study how these immune system responses are different from person to person and try to find predictors of disease severity,\u201d Langlois says. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t By analyzing blood samples for neutralizing antibodies from these two cohorts, Langlois says the study\u2019s findings could help determine a minimum threshold of protection that could then predict whether someone\u2019s immune system is likely to keep them safe from infection or more serious complications related to COVID-19. He cautions, however, that immune responses vary greatly from person to person, and that the study won\u2019t give a standardized timeframe of immunity after a coronavirus infection. At best, the study could provide probabilities of infection based on various individual predictors, such as genetic markers. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know for sure if they can get reinfected or what the severity of that infection is,\u201d Langlois says. \u201cIt will never be a black and white scenario where we say, \u2018Here\u2019s your stamp \u2014 you\u2019re protected.\u2019\u201d The Ottawa-based team, which includes epidemiologists, clinicians, legal and ethics experts, hopes to publish findings from the study in a year\u2019s time, but Langlois notes that some research updates will likely be published as they go, given the time-sensitive nature of the work. The researchers are currently looking for more participants  ."},

She had also written that \u201cwe don\u2019t need a vaccine,\u201d and shared a Tweet claiming that contact tracing, testing and isolation were \u201cineffective, naive & counter-productive against COVID-19.\u201d The college\u2019s complaints committee cautioned Gill for all three posts, citing a \u201clack of professionalism and failure to exercise caution in her posts on social media, which is irresponsible behaviour for a member of the profession and presents a possible risk to public health.\u201d The college said Gill intended to appeal the rulings. A   issued by an organization headed by her lawyer accused the college of \u201cselectively, and in bad faith\u201d taking her comments out of context, and ignoring \u201cworld scientific and medical opinion\u201d supporting her. She retweeted the statement. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The first of their type, the cautions come as Canada\u2019s doctors are growing increasingly concerned about misinformation and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 that have become pervasive online. \u201cA caution arises where the committee is concerned about an aspect of a physician\u2019s practise or professionalism or conduct,\u201d Carolyn Silver, the college\u2019s general counsel, told Global News. \u201cIt is meant to protect the public. A summary of the decision, as you can see, is on the public website. So it is public information and that information becomes part of the physician\u2019s history.\u201d \u201cAnd if any subsequent concerns arise with respect to a physician\u2019s practise or conduct or professionalism, that history is available to the college to consider.\u201d The   said in a statement responding to the cautions that it was important to use \u201cscience and proven public health measures as the basis for decisions on how to curb the pandemic, despite the alarming amount of misinformation still being spread about COVID-19.\u201d In its decision, the college said that while it was valid to point out that lockdowns had drawbacks, and to question if they were working or whether the costs outweighed the benefits, Gill had gone beyond that. \u201cShe stated unequivocally and without providing any evidence that there is no medical or scientific reason for the lockdown,\u201d the college wrote. \u201cHer statement does not align with the information coming from public health, and moreover, it is not accurate,\u201d according to the ruling. Lockdowns in China and South Korea were evidence they reduced the spread of COVID-19, the college wrote. \u201cFor the respondent to state otherwise is misinformed and misleading and furthermore an irresponsible statement to make on social medial during a pandemic,\u201d the decision read. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Gill is the co-founder of the advocacy group Concerned Ontario Doctors. Her Twitter account has more than 56,000 followers. She could not be reached for comment. Her claim that vaccinations were not needed was also deemed inappropriate by the college, which said vaccines had been tested and approved in Canada and were the best way to end the pandemic. \u201cWhile it is possible for a return to \u2018normal life\u2019 without vaccinating the public, this is a high-risk strategy and one that could potentially take years to achieve,\u201d the college wrote. According to the decision, Gill provided no evidence to support the statement that vaccines were not necessary. \u201cIt would be expected and understandable if a certain proportion of the general public who read this statement decided to decline the vaccine with the assurance that they were acting on the guidance of a physician,\u201d the college wrote. \u201cFor this reason, the committee considered it irresponsible, and a potential risk to public health, for the respondent to have made this statement in the middle of a pandemic.\u201d The college complaints committee additionally took Gill to task for retweeting that contact tracing, testing and isolation were counter-productive, a view it called \u201cindefensible.\u201d \u201cThe committee would expect a certain proportion of the non-medically trained public who read this post to subsequently decide not to follow government and public health rules and recommendations regarding contact tracing, testing and isolation,\u201d the ruling read. \u201cThis could have significant negative consequences for public health. The Respondent\u2019s comments in this regard are irresponsible and careless in the current context and climate.\u201d While Gill had argued her tweets were taken out of context, the college said that tweets by nature had \u201climited context.\u201d Nor did the college accept that her tweets were made on a personal account. \u201cThe respondent\u2019s Twitter biography makes it very clear that she is a physician and also identifies her as the leader of a group of physicians, Concerned Ontario Doctors,\u201d it said. \u201cThe respondent\u2019s tweets are accessible by the public. Moreover, members of the public who are not healthcare professionals are likely to attribute significant weight and authority to the respondent\u2019s tweets, given her profession.\u201d Stewart.Bell@globalnews.ca"},

The U.S. patient was suffering from priapism, which involves a persistent erection that outlasts or has nothing to do with sexual stimulation, according to the case report published in the January edition of  . \n\t\t\t \n\t\t According to the case report, the patient had a history of obesity and was suffering from a prolonged cough, congestion, anorexia, weakness and shortness of breath when he went to the emergency room at Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, last year. He tested positive for COVID-19 and remained in hospital for several days, during which his health continued to decline. He was eventually sedated, intubated, placed on a ventilator and moved into a prone position to make him more comfortable. \u201cNursing noticed an erection\u201d on the afternoon after he was repositioned, doctors wrote in the case study. Health-care workers tried to help by placing ice packs around the man\u2019s penis, but it stayed erect for three hours. Experts took a look at the man and ran ultrasound scans. They ultimately determined that he was suffering from ischemic priapism, an urgent and potentially dangerous condition during which blood cannot leave the penis. The condition was likely triggered by a blood clot caused by COVID-19, according to the case report. Doctors gave the man medication to help with his blood flow, then used needles to drain some of the blood and provide his penis with a bit of relief. His erection lasted for a total of three hours by the time they managed to tame it. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The patient was placed on an IV drip after the episode, according to the case report, but his condition continued to worsen. He suffered a prolonged course of acute respiratory distress syndrome, was moved to the intensive care unit and ultimately died. Doctors say he did not have another case of priapism before the end. The episode was extremely rare for a   patient, but the authors point out that there has been one other   of such an issue in France. In the French episode, a 62-year-old man with COVID-19 had an erection for four hours. The erection did not go down with help from ice packs and ultimately had to be drained with a needle.

{"title": "Nearly 20% of Canadians still hesitant or refusing to get COVID-19 vaccine: poll - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted June 18, 2021 3:00 am", "body": "Nearly 20 per cent of Canadians still need to be convinced to get vaccinated against  , a new poll suggests \u2014 with one in 10 saying they definitely won\u2019t get the shot. The Ipsos poll conducted exclusively for Global News found 82 per cent of the 1,000 adults surveyed have either already been vaccinated or are awaiting their appointment. That bodes well for a high level of immunity among the Canadian population, particularly if those who are unsure can be convinced to get the jab. \u201cIf you can get up to 90 per cent (of the population inoculated) in any jurisdiction, I think most epidemiologists would say we\u2019re doing pretty well,\u201d said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs. Yet the poll also found mixed enthusiasm for various incentives that could push people to get vaccinated, including cash lotteries and time off from work. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t While the nine per cent of those refusing to get the shot may never be convinced, Bricker says the group that\u2019s unsure will likely continue to shrink as access improves and first-hand experience grows. \u201cThe more people that they know, the more people, their families and their close social circles that get vaccinated and are OK, that will convince them to to try things on themselves,\u201d he said. After a sluggish winter that saw supply issues and long waits for eligibility to expand, Canada\u2019s vaccination campaign has become a success story. The country is now among the top five in the world in administering high numbers of doses daily, and leads the globe in the share of the total population that has received at least one dose \u2014 more than 65 per cent. According to the   75 per cent of eligible Canadians have received at least one dose, while at least 18 per cent are fully vaccinated with two doses. Federal health officials have said the country needs to reach a 75 per cent inoculation rate among Canadians aged 12 and over for provinces and territories to begin safely loosening health restrictions, with at least 20 per cent fully vaccinated. However, Canada\u2019s chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam said this week that the first number should potentially be bumped up beyond 80 per cent due to the highly transmissible Delta variant, which is on track to become the dominant form of COVID-19 in the country. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Although the Ipsos poll suggests the country may be on track to reach that updated goal, it also found concerning gaps in who is resisting the shot. Among the respondents, women were more likely than men to say they are hesitant (20 per cent versus 18 per cent) or \u201cdefinitely not\u201d getting the vaccine (11 per cent compared to six per cent of men). Younger Canadians also showed more hesitancy, with 15 per cent of those aged 18 to 35 saying they were unsure, compared to 11 per cent of 35 to 54-year-olds and only two per cent of those aged 55 and up. Another 10 per cent of young adults said they would not get the shot at all. Bricker says past polling has shown women are generally more cautious about taking risks, particularly when it comes to their health. Younger people in some parts of the country may also still be waiting to become eligible for their shot, he adds, or are ensuring more vulnerable populations get inoculated first. What\u2019s also troubling, Bricker says, is that some parts of the country like Atlantic Canada showed higher numbers of hesitancy or refusal in the poll compared to other provinces. More than 20 per cent Atlantic respondents said they were unsure if they\u2019ll get a shot, compared to just seven per cent in Quebec. \u201cIf (hesitancy is) concentrated among specific groups of the population, particularly specific groups of the population that come in contact with each other a lot, that\u2019s a big problem,\u201d he said. \u201cTen percent (refusal or hesitancy) generally distributed across the population, that\u2019s less of a risk than if it\u2019s, say, 25 per cent of youth in a particular area.\u201d Some provinces are trying to combat hesitancy by offering perks to those who get their shot. Alberta this week launched a $1-million lottery, while Manitoba is offering several prizes of $100,000. But the poll suggests those incentives may only sway about half of unvaccinated adults at most. Just 55 per cent of those surveyed said the chance to win $1 million would change their minds, while the rest held firm. About the same number of unvaccinated adults said they could be tempted by Manitoba\u2019s prize system and other potential rewards, including smaller cash payments or a paid day off from work. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Bricker says even those gains are worth it. \u201cEvery centimeter of that last kilometer is going to count,\u201d he said. \u201cThat last 10 per cent \u2014 the people that are really, truly not ever going to consider this \u2014 there\u2019s really little incentive that you can offer to them to get them on. \u2026 But that other 10 per cent that are (unsure), these different incentives are not necessarily a bad idea.\u201d Bricker said further incentives will also come from society, as governments and businesses debate issues like vaccine passports or barring unvaccinated people from certain activities and large gatherings. \u201cUnless people are absolute hermits, this will be another thing that pushes them into into considering being vaccinated,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think that the data is showing that there\u2019s way, way more opportunity to vaccinate people today than there is a need to really focus on convincing people that they need to be vaccinated.\u201d"},

Premier Iain Rankin said at a COVID-19 briefing that more than 1,000 appointments have been cancelled and that more people are choosing Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. \u201cThere is a study to determine if the first dose of AstraZeneca can mix with a second dose of either Pfizer or Moderna. We are waiting until that is complete, (so in the meantime) we are pausing the vaccine,\u201d said Rankin. Rankin said this will not affect the province\u2019s vaccine rollout. \u201cThe decision to pause the use of AstraZeneca vaccine is based on caution, science and the availability of alternative mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. It is the best solution to move people getting AstraZeneca to receive mRNA instead,\u201d said Nova Scotia\u2019s chief medical officer of health, Dr. Robert Strang. Anyone who is scheduled to receive their first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine will be contacted by their clinic for a new appointment for either a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine as soon as possible. As the province announced a new paid sick leave program for Nova Scotians Wednesday, Strang said that it\u2019s good news for people who are sick due to COVID-19 and have to self-isolate. \u201cWorkplaces have become major contributors to COVID-19 transmission and we all need to work together to stay safe \u2026 so have your employees work from home if possible,\u201d said Strang. People who cannot work remotely and miss less than 50 per cent of their scheduled work time in a one-week period due to COVID-19 may be eligible. Nova Scotia reported 149 new cases and 119 recoveries on Wednesday. There are 116 new cases in Central Zone, 13 in Western Zone, 11 in Eastern Zone and nine in Northern Zone. The province also announced that as of now, public health has cleared the backlog of positive cases. \u201cAll positive cases have been contacted and entered into Panorama, the data system,\u201d the province said in a news release. As of Wednesday, Nova Scotia has 1,621 active cases of COVID-19. There are 73 people in hospital, including 14 in ICU. On Tuesday, Nova Scotia Health Authority\u2019s labs completed 7,289 tests. So far, 387,683 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 38,152 Nova Scotians have received their second dose. Since April 1, there have been 2,559 positive COVID-19 cases and five deaths. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. There are 933 resolved cases. Cumulative cases may change as data is updated in Panorama. Strang said even though numbers of new cases are trending downwards compared to a few weeks ago, the number of hospitalizations is still high. He said some patients in ICUs in Halifax had to be transported to other zones. \u201cAll aspects of our health-care systems are being impacted. We are not out of the woods yet. Hospitalizations may still increase while new cases are declining,\u201d Strang said. Nova Scotia Provincial Parks is delaying the start of camping season at provincial camping parks until at least June 1 due to COVID-19 restrictions. In a release, the province said campers\u00a0with reservations between May 21 and 31 will be contacted by email to cancel and refund their bookings. \u201cCampers should not cancel their own reservations,\u201d said the province. Campers who have already cancelled their reservations since May 7 will receive a refund. They should allow up to 10 business days to receive a refund. In the meantime, day-use parks and day-use areas of campgrounds continue to be open for outdoor recreation. People should only visit parks in their own community."},

Polling by   done exclusively for Global News shows 81 per cent of respondents reported feeling worried that the spread of new variants will delay things getting back to normal. Sixty-nine per cent also reported concerns about the potential for a fourth wave, with those fears lowest in Alberta and Quebec. Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos Public Affairs, said the numbers suggest Canadians are bracing themselves. \u201cThey feel at the moment that we are on the precipice of potentially going into more difficult circumstances,\u201d he told Global News, noting 62 per cent also said they believe vaccines will mitigate the impact of any future surge. \u201cThe way I would best describe it is that people right now are preparing for the worst, but hoping for the best.\u201d The rapid spread of more contagious variants of COVID-19 has led to roaring spikes in cases among unvaccinated people in the United States in recent weeks, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to re-introduce guidance advising vaccinated people to wear masks indoors. In B.C. as well, rising cases among the unvaccinated led officials to announce they are targeting one million unvaccinated residents to try to limit the spread and potential overload of the health system. \u201cThe reality is that with the Delta variant and other variants of concern out there, it is likely that we will see a rise in cases over the coming months,\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday. At the same time, speculation is rampant that Trudeau will soon pull the plug on the minority government he has led since October 2019 and force Canadians back out to the polls. Citing sources, Reuters reported on Wednesday that Trudeau is eyeing September for an election. But even as concerns remain about the potential for a fourth wave, polling suggests Canadians\u2019 levels of concern are shifting to include a broader range of issues beyond COVID-19. In the polling released on Tuesday, 49 per cent of Canadians said recent extreme weather events like the wildfires blazing across B.C. and northern Ontario have made them feel more strongly about the need to fight climate change, with young Canadians and those with university degrees most inclined to agree.   Young Canadians in particular are a key voting bloc that political parties will be trying to motivate to get out to the polls, but Bricker said it remains to be seen what shifting priorities or a surge in COVID-19 cases could mean for a federal election this fall. He pointed to climate change as well as growing demands to act on inequality and injustice. \u201cThose issues have started to come up and as they come up, the Liberal\u2019s prospects about getting reelected become a little more challenged because they\u2019re not seen as performing necessarily well on those issues,\u201d he said. Bricker added the government has high approval numbers on its handling of the pandemic and would likely see a bump in support if it had to campaign primarily on the COVID-19 response. \u201cIt\u2019s a real wild card,\u201d he said."},

President and CEO of Public Health Ontario Dr. Peter Donnelly alongside President and CEO of Ontario Health Matthew Anderson and Dean of the Dalla Lana School of Public Health Adalsteinn Brown revealed the projected numbers at Queen\u2019s Park on Friday. The data also indicated that Ontario would have seen 300,000 cases of COVID-19 and 6,000 deaths by the end of the month if there was no government action or intervention. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe are following a trajectory somewhat similar to that in the United States, not quite as good currently, as that in British Columbia,\u201d Donnelly said. \u201cBut I would hastened to say that when one tracks cases, it really is rather difficult to know exactly where you stand, you have to watch it extremely carefully, because it is rather dependent upon who you test for the disease.\u201d \u201cOver the full two-year course of the pandemic, had we done nothing, Ontario may have suffered 100,000 deaths,\u201d Donnelly added. \u201cThankfully that is not the position that we are in. Because of the very detailed actions\u2026 which have been taken in response to the emerging science, we believe that if we can do all that we can, we can get a much better end result for the province.\u201d \u201cWe must take these warnings seriously,\u201d Premier Doug Ford said. \u201cWe must recognize that the numbers also show that everything we\u2019ve done so far, everything we\u2019ve done together since this started is working.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThanks to every person out there listening to the advice of our health professionals, staying at home, keeping their distance and doing what they can to keep this virus contained,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe numbers clearly show that we have collectively saved thousands of lives.\u201d The Premier went on to stress that we still have \u201c1,600 people out there who need us to do everything we can in the next 30 days to help save them.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s 50 people a day, or two people dead every hour,\u201d he said.

The final tally for deaths by the end of the pandemic, with public measures in place, is projected to be roughly 3,000 to 15,000 for the province with the current modelling system. Donnelly admitted that the range is wide but said it is entirely possible to be on the higher end. \u201cWhen you remember that we have no vaccine, we have no specific treatment, and this is a disease which is entirely new to the population \u2014 then suddenly the figure of 15,000 becomes entirely logical and comprehensible,\u201d Donnelly said, adding that it is important now more than ever to practice physical and social distancing among other measures implemented by the government. Ford said that he had been shown \u201cworldwide models\u201d in the past but had only seen these projections on Thursday. He said they needed to wait to release projections because they had to give health officials time to put them together once all those who were travelling out of province came back and isolated. In Toronto, the city\u2019s chief medical officers said it could see 600 to 3000 deaths by the end of the pandemic based on the provincial numbers. \u201cI know these numbers are stark. Seeing what our future may look like based on this data is truly sobering and even frightening,\u201d said Eileen de Villa. \u201cBut these are more than just numbers. They are our friends, our families, our neighbours, members of our community. They are our essential workers, our health care workers and they are the people who work each and every day to help keep us safe. \u201cMost of all, these deaths are preventable. This is what keeps me up at night. We each have an opportunity and a personal responsibility to prevent this from happening.\u201d :   projections show w/o public health measures, over the course of the   pandemic  100,000 Ontarians would have died, that figure is now 3,000-15,000 with public measures. The assumptions are based on the data right now, these projections could change.  \u2014 Travis Dhanraj (@Travisdhanraj)  Ontario reported 462 new COVID-19 cases on Friday, bringing the provincial total to 3,255 including 67 deaths and 1,023 resolved cases.

They ask questions to get an idea of who the infected person has been around. \u201cThey really do try and get a really detailed history of where you\u2019ve been, what you\u2019ve been doing, how long you were there, who you saw, how much time you had with them,\u201d explained the University of Alberta\u2019s infectious disease specialist Dr. Lynora Saxinger. She said all of that information is critical in determining who else might be sick. \u201cA close contact would be somebody who is within that two metres or six feet of another individual for 15 minutes or longer,\u201d explained Angela Jacobs, associate manager of Alberta Health Services\u2019 notifiable disease program. Jacobs explained that those 15 minutes are cumulative \u2014 so being near someone on multiple occasions for a few minutes at a time can also increase your exposure. But time isn\u2019t the only factor that\u2019s variable; the amount of physical contact in each situation is also relevant and leads to more risk. \u201cIf you had contact with somebody else\u2019s body fluids, somebody coughed or sneezed on you, you maybe shared a drink or a cigarette, a lip gloss or a fork,\u201d Jacobs said. Kissing or hugging someone would also make you a close contact, regardless of the duration. Other activities, including singing, can also make someone more likely to be considered a  . In Alberta, close contacts are notified by AHS, need to get tested and self-isolate for two weeks, even if their test comes back negative. Another factor contact tracers consider is the setting. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been distanced for the entire time, particularly if it\u2019s outside, you\u2019re probably won\u2019t be named as a contact. Indoor exposures become a little more complicated,\u201d Saxinger explained. With Thanksgiving weekend coming up, many families are hoping to get together \u2013 but that can amplify risk, especially if the people aren\u2019t in your cohort. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a small space, somebody\u2019s living room or kitchen, for a couple of hours \u2014 even if you\u2019re staying six feet apart \u2014 we might consider you a close contact,\u201d Jacobs said. Jacobs also noted wearing masks is helpful in reducing the risk of getting COVID-19, however, it does not eliminate the risk \u2013 and it does not mean you can forget about social distancing. \u201cIt\u2019s not one or the other. Your best protection is wearing a non-medical mask and maintaining the six feet or two metres. And staying home if you\u2019re symptomatic,\u201d Jacobs explained. She also notes   is a tool contact tracers use, but said many people forget it needs to be running on their phone to work. The federal COVID-19 app is not yet available in Alberta. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t While it\u2019s recognized being a close contact, having to get tested and isolate is inconvenient, Jacobs said contact tracers need to focus on protecting people. \u201cWe do often err on the side of caution because at the end of the day, we really want to make sure we\u2019re doing the best we can to prevent that spread.\u201d"},

This past weekend\u2019s walk-in clinic in northeast Calgary was equipped with 5,000 doses of vaccine, however, only about 2,000 were given out over the two days it was open. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t According to one of the doctors behind the clinic, hundreds of people came asking for second doses of vaccine, but because of the parameters set out by Alberta Health Services, they had to be turned away. \u201cThey wanted second doses when we had chairs that were empty, doctors that were waiting and vaccines 30 metres away in the fridge,\u201d said Dr. Gabriel Fabreau, physician at the Peter Lougheed Centre and assistant professor at the University of Calgary. \u201cI think every single vaccination opportunity that is lost is a detriment to the population.\u201d When asked why the people were turned away, AHS said the clinic was \u201cfocused on reaching individuals who had not yet had their first dose and providing them an accessible and comfortable environment to receive their COVID-19 immunization.\u201d AHS said \u201conly a small number of people showed up seeking their second dose,\u201d and they were provided with guidance on eligibility, how to book an appointment and given handouts that explained eligibility criteria. The information was provided in more than 20 languages for those whose first language wasn\u2019t English. The doses that weren\u2019t used as part of the clinic were brought to other clinics, and no doses were wasted, AHS said. Similarly, in the first day of Calgary\u2019s Telus Convention Centre walk-up vaccination blitz, only 200 of the available 2,000 first-dose shots were administered. Day 2 saw about 200 people drop in for shots by 4:30 p.m. as well. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Numbers at Edmonton\u2019s drop-in clinic weren\u2019t far off. AHS said 168 people dropped in at the Edmonton centre Wednesday. The Expo site has the capacity for more than 200 drop-in vaccinations a day, according to AHS. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Across the province, just over 3,800 vaccine appointments were unfilled Tuesday at AHS sites, according to the health authority. \u201cGiven that we have large numbers of doses potentially not being used, I think we should open it wide up. Any age, any time, get your second doses,\u201d said Dr. Noel Gibney, co-chair of the Strategic COVID-19 Pandemic Committee. \u201cIt seems a terrible shame to have vaccine available but nobody turning up to be vaccinated.\u201d Dr. Chuck Wurster, an emergency physician at Strathcona Community Hospital in Sherwood Park, agreed. With shipments of Moderna and Pfizer expected this month, he said Alberta should be \u201cflush\u201d with vaccine doses and supply shouldn\u2019t be an issue. When asked about the second dose rollout on Tuesday, Dr. Deena Hinshaw said the province is looking into whether it can accelerate the timeline. As of Wednesday, Alberta Health said no changes had been made to the eligibilities. \u201cWe\u2019re already using a lot of creative approaches, including working with partners to host temporary clinics at shelters, meat-packing plants, work camps and other locations, and launching our first-ever drive-through clinic in northeast Calgary,\u201d spokesperson Tom McMillan said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Manitoba announced Wednesday a  . \u201cA lottery model similar to what was announced in Manitoba would be great in Alberta,\u201d said Gibney. \u201cI think it would get a lot of those individuals who aren\u2019t deeply set against vaccine, kind of sitting on the fence\u2026 it would give them a real incentive to get vaccinated.\u201d McMillan said the government was \u201cassessing whether lotteries or other tools would be good additions to our rollout,\u201d as a means of incentivizing Albertans to get their shot. As of Tuesday, 67.2 per cent of eligible Albertans had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, an increase 0.5 per cent since Sunday."},

There will be no limits on indoor gatherings or province-wide mask mandates, but   is urging residents to remember the pandemic is not over. In her last regularly scheduled COVID-19 update on Tuesday, the province\u2019s chief medical officer of health asked residents to get vaccinated, continue with good hand hygiene and weigh the benefits vs. the rewards of activities. \u201cIt means making safe choices when we enter Stage 3, not because there is an order directing it, but because it is the right thing to do.\u201d Alberta confirmed an additional 61 cases of COVID-19 over the past 24 hours.  There were 170 Albertans in hospital, with 36 of them receiving care in the ICU. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t While numbers like active cases and hospitalizations continue to decline, Hinshaw said the virus is not going away completely. She urged Albertans to continue to stay home and arrange to get tested if they are showing signs of COVID-19. Moving forward, the province will continue to offer testing for symptomatic Albertans and new case identification, variant testing and contact tracing will continue. Health officials will continue to investigate outbreaks and will take \u201cwhatever steps are needed to protect the public\u2019s health,\u201d Hinshaw said. While most restrictions are lifting on Thursday, rules designed to protect the residents at continuing care facilities will remain in place. On July 5, two designated visitors will be able to visit a patient at one time. \u201cWe will keep robust measures in place in order to watch closely to see what impacts Stage 3 may have,\u201d Hinshaw said. The province is currently conducting town halls to talk to residents, staff and family members to determine when and what to change when it comes to continuing care facilities. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Hinshaw also used her final update to remind Albertans about the importance of being fully immunized. \u201cWe have seen the power of vaccines,\u201d she said. \u201cThey drastically reduce the chance of catching this virus and, if people are exposed, of experiencing extreme outcomes like hospitalization.\u201d Since January, Hinshaw said, more than 95 per cent of new cases and 92 per cent of hospitalizations were in people who were either unvaccinated or were within the two weeks of receiving their first dose. \u201cThe number one best thing we can do to protect ourselves, those around us and to keep Alberta open is to sign up, show up and follow up for both doses of vaccine.\u201d Due to changes in how the vaccine data is reported, 72.7 per cent of Albertans aged 12 and older have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and 40.7 of those eligible are fully vaccinated. But what about those who are under 12? There is still no word on when children will be eligible to receive the vaccine. That means the coming months may be harder for families with young children, Hinshaw said. She urged parents to encourage all eligible family members to get vaccinated and to be intentional when examining activities in the coming months. Risks for younger children can be mitigated by continuing to reduce close contacts and by choosing outdoor activities. \u201cEach family will need to make the decision that is right for them. There is no single perfect answer,\u201d Hinshaw said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Children under 12 continue to have the lowest risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 and Hinshaw said parents should incorporate that fact when deciding what their family will decide is safe this summer. Vaccine trials are underway for kids in that age group. On Tuesday, Alberta Health confirmed an additional 61 cases of COVID-19, bringing the provincial active case rate to 1,132. As of Tuesday\u2019s update, there were 170 people in hospital with COVID-19 and 36 of those people were receiving care in the ICU. Four additional deaths were reported to Alberta Health over the past 24 hours. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t A woman in her 50s and a man in his 60s in the North zone, a man in his 60s in the Calgary zone and a man in his 60s in the Central zone have all died.

{"title": "Canada\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination rate is slowing. That\u2019s leading to wastage, experts warn - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted July 21, 2021 11:27 pm", "body": "Canada\u2019s demand for   vaccines is slowly dropping, experts say, and they warn those waiting to see whether cases spike before getting their jabs are wasting time the body needs to build sufficient immunity. Less than one per cent (0.98) of Canadians were vaccinated per day over the last week, a decrease from the record-high daily rate of 1.44 at the end of June, according Our World in Data. A vaccine tracker created by a University of Saskatchewan student shows daily average first doses have dropped to fewer than 40,000 from roughly 96,000 a month ago. A drop is to be expected, since 80 per cent of the eligible population already has at least one dose and close to 60 per cent are fully vaccinated. Canada\u2019s vaccine uptake and rate of vaccination is still among the highest in the world \u2014 France is vaccinating 0.92 per cent of its population per day while the United Kingdom is at 0.34. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t But Kelly Grindrod, a pharmacy professor at the University of Waterloo, says a slowing rate is concerning, and the spread of new variants means more Canadians need to be fully protected to mitigate future outbreaks. Grindrod pointed to countries with high vaccine uptake, including the U.K. and the Netherlands, that are seeing new infection waves, largely hitting unvaccinated populations. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very difficult stage of apathy, where people don\u2019t think they\u2019re at risk,\u201d Grindrod said. \u201cBut \u2026 there\u2019s a real concern that if you wait until the numbers go up to get vaccinated, it\u2019s too late.\u201d Grindrod said some of the slowdown might have to do with people delaying second doses when offered a Moderna shot, preferring to wait for Pfizer-BioNTech instead. Even waiting a few days delays protection, Grindrod said, as immune systems require two weeks after dose 2 to build optimal levels of antibodies. Anyone still waiting for their first jab must wait another four weeks for their second dose, putting themselves at an even greater disadvantage. Concern over mixing Pfizer and Moderna shots appears to be driving some hesitancy, she said. Though experts have repeatedly said the two mRNA jabs are interchangeable, confusion remains. Mixing mRNA vaccines became wider spread in Canada last month, when delayed Pfizer shipments coincided with an influx of Moderna. Kyro Maseh, a pharmacist in Toronto, said he and his colleagues have a harder time moving Moderna vaccines, and he fears a Pfizer preference will result in large amounts of wastage. \u201cI\u2019m about to throw out 350 doses of Moderna,\u201d Maseh said. \u201cAnother country would gladly take that off our hands.\u201d Maseh said part of the issue is that each Moderna vial contains 14 doses, compared to Pfizer\u2019s six. Once a vial is punctured, its contents need to be used within 24 hours. Vials that are thawed from their freezing temperatures need to be used within a month. Maseh said the problem isn\u2019t that Canada is receiving too many doses now, but that messaging over mixing vaccines has hit roadblocks in recent days. Last week,   of individuals seeking out different vaccines on their own for third or fourth doses, a quote that was taken out of context to suggest mixing doses wasn\u2019t advised. Grindrod said colleagues recounted seeing people reading and sharing the story with others while in line at a mass vaccine clinic in Cambridge, Ont. \u2014 and then walking out. Travel concerns could also be a factor. A story last week about Barbados not recognizing Canada\u2019s mixed-dose strategy prompted more hesitation, Grindrod said, even though the Caribbean country quickly reversed its policy. Norwegian Cruise Line said on its website that vessels embarking and disembarking from U.S. ports won\u2019t accept mixed vaccination, though ships from non-U.S. ports will. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much for people to delay (their second doses) and that\u2019s a real concern,\u201d Grindrod said. \u201cPeople are thinking very far into the future about travel, and that\u2019s another way of saying they don\u2019t believe they\u2019re at risk right now.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Celia Du, a science communications specialist in Toronto, said debunking negative perceptions about mixed doses can be difficult once they\u2019re ingrained. Experts can get bogged down in scientific language and lose peoples\u2019 attention, she said, so it\u2019s often the quick and simple headlines \u2014 even if misleading \u2014 that people tend to remember. \u201cFinding ways to make the truth short and sweet is always a good strategy,\u201d she said. Maseh said people who delay vaccination now, as restrictions lift and travel resumes, risk being vulnerable at a time when COVID-19 could soon rise. The lack of vaccine access in other parts of the world is also troubling, he added. And while Canada is doing well to keep COVID-19 at bay now, Maseh said the threat of new variants developing and spreading could spell trouble. \u201cBy taking perfectly good vaccines and tossing them in the trash, you\u2019re shooting yourself in the foot down the road,\u201d he said."},

Developing a plan to be physically active now will help you to stay strong and healthy through the long winter ahead. While most people are aware of the   \u2014 increased muscle and strength, reduced risk of disease, better quality of life and a lower risk of death \u2014 we tend to be less aware of how   and   reduced physical activity can be. The loss of muscle and strength as you get older (known as  ) is something with which we are all familiar. We have all heard older family members say, \u201cI\u2019m just not as strong as I used to be,\u201d or \u201cI just can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d But did you know that inactivity can make muscle loss a whole lot worse? Physical inactivity can be forced on a person by an acute event such as a broken arm or leg or becoming bed-bound due to illness. However, reduced physical activity, such as step reduction, is a long-term choice that brings about multiple negative health consequences. Insulin resistance (a warning sign for the development of type 2 diabetes), reduced muscle mass, increased body fat and poor sleep quality are just some of the   caused by physical inactivity. Physical inactivity is also a major contributor to  , which can be particularly problematic for older adults. The health effects of inactivity start piling up within days.  that reducing daily steps to fewer than 1,500 \u2014 similar to the activity level of people who are housebound during this pandemic \u2014 for just two weeks can reduce an older person\u2019s insulin sensitivity by as much as one-third. The same period of inactivity also led to individuals over age 65 losing as much as four per cent of their leg muscle. To make matters worse, once an older individual loses muscle, it is much more difficult to restore. Even when the research subjects returned to their normal daily routines, they did not regain their lost muscle. Effectively, older individuals simply don\u2019t possess the same ability to bounce back that younger people do. Regaining muscle requires deliberate effort. So, it truly is a case of use it or lose it. As a muscle physiologist with a keen interest in healthy aging, I\u2019m pleased to report it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. There are some things you can do \u2014   \u2014 to keep and even build muscle, get stronger and maintain your health for this winter and beyond. The most effective way to maintain the muscle you have is strength training, or  , which, put simply, means performing work against an additional load. And it doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. If you have access to a gym to use free-weights and guided-motion machines, that\u2019s great. However, there are many valuable  . Body-weight exercises such as push-ups, squats and lunges, elastic-band exercises and stair-climbing are just a few options that will help you to meet the  . The good news for those who may be put off by the sound of resistance exercise is that doing any exercise with a high degree of effort will help you to get stronger and prevent (at least some) muscle loss. If, for any reason, performing resistance exercise isn\u2019t possible, simply adding a walk, a bike ride or some lower-intensity strength exercises such as yoga or Pilates to your daily routine can have significant physical and  .

Protein-rich foods are particularly important, since they make you feel fuller for longer and provide building blocks for your muscles. It is generally agreed that older adults need   than   suggest. A good, easily achievable, target would be to eat 25 to 40 grams of protein with each meal (about one or two palm-sized portions). This equates to approximately 1.2 to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass each day. Also, getting your protein from both animal (dairy, meat, fish, and eggs) and plant-based (beans, nuts, seeds, and lentils) sources may be beneficial."},

In a news release issued Tuesday night, Dr. Deena Hinshaw said the fatality was confirmed to be linked to \u201cvaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).\u201d Family confirmed to Global News that the woman who died was  \u201cShe was my rock,\u201d Lisa\u2019s 19-year-old daughter Jordan told Global News. \u201cMy mom was just a great person\u2026 She was so happy and fun loving. Every time you were with her you couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cShe always put others in front of herself,\u201d Jordan said. During a news conference Wednesday morning, Health Minister Tyler Shandro offered his condolences. \u201cMy thoughts are with the patient\u2019s family and all of her loved ones. It\u2019s a tragedy for them.\u201d Hinshaw said for patient confidentiality reasons, she would not provide additional case information. \u201cWhile any death is tragic, it is important to remember that the risks of dying or suffering other severe outcomes from COVID-19 remain far greater than the risk following AstraZeneca vaccine,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Alberta case marks the second VITT case and only death related to VITT out of more than 253,000 doses of AstraZeneca or CoviSHIELD/AstraZeneca that have been administered in Alberta to date.\u201d Hinshaw noted that the global frequency of VITT has been estimated at roughly one case in 100,000 to 250,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. \u201cIn comparison, Albertans 50 to 59 who are diagnosed with COVID-19 are 350 times more likely to die from that infection than to experience VITT after an AstraZeneca vaccine. They are also at least 1,500 times more likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19 than experiencing VITT after getting AstraZeneca.\u201d Shandro acknowledged the news may be a shock for anyone who has received or is thinking about getting the AstraZeneca vaccine, but he echoed Hinshaw\u2019s comments, encouraging people to still get vaccinated and warning of the risks of a blood clot if diagnosed with COVID-19. \u201cThis does not change the relative risks of vaccination or the message that people need to get vaccinated,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the risks from COVID as high as they currently are, the best vaccine is the one that\u2019s available right now to anyone and everyone that is currently eligible.\u201d Shandro encouraged anyone with questions about the vaccine to speak to their doctor or another health-care professional. Last month, Canada reported its first case of a rare blood clot in a person who had received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. A Quebec woman who passed away in late April was the first Canadian to die of the condition after receiving the vaccine. Some new questions have been raised about the AstraZeneca vaccine after the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) offered additional guidance on vaccines earlier this week. On Wednesday, the chair of NACI issued a statement about its recent \u201cpreferential recommendation\u201d for mRNA vaccines. \u201cPeople seem to think that it means that if they received the AstraZeneca vaccine, they got a second-best shot,\u201d Caroline Quach-Thanh said in an email. \u201cThe recommendation is not a retrospective one. That means that everyone who (has) received the AstraZeneca vaccine have been protected against COVID-19. \u201cIn fact, effectiveness (real-world data) show that the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine is as effective as the first dose of an mRNA vaccine in preventing hospitalizations and deaths due to the original SARS-CoV-2 and the variant that was first identified in the U.K. \u201cPeople who did get their AstraZeneca vaccine, mainly when COVID-19 was being transmitted in their community, actually did the right thing. They protected themselves and their families against COVID-19 complications.\u201d Quach-Thanh said the \u201cpreferential recommendation\u201d this week was aimed at those not yet vaccinated. \u201cWhat we are asking is for people to evaluate their individual risk of catching COVID-19 over the next few weeks, as there should be enough mRNA vaccine doses for people to access a dose between now and the next five weeks or so,\u201d she said. \u201cDepending on where one lives and of what one does, risk of catching COVID varies. If your risk of COVID is moderate to high, get the first vaccine available now. If not, then one needs to balance out the risk of COVID complications against the risk of VITT (Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia) that, although rare, does exist and may lead to severe complications.\u201d Quach-Thanh added that VITT \u201chas been associated with the viral vector vaccines and not with the mRNA vaccines, at this time.\u201d"},

Officials confirmed on Friday that the province will move into Step 3 on July 16 at 12:01 a.m. Ontario was originally slated to move into the next step on July 21. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any reason to hold us back given that so many Ontarians have come forward. Over 200,000 (people a day) are coming forward to get immunized,\u201d Dr. Kieran Moore, Ontario\u2019s new chief medical officer of health, told reporters Friday afternoon. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Step 3 of the reopening plan focuses on expanding indoor settings and further bolsters outdoor settings. Here are the major changes that will come into effect when the province enters Step 3: Provincial officials said masks and face coverings will remain in place in indoor public settings throughout Step 3 as will physical distancing requirements. Masks will be required in some outdoor settings along with other public health measures. Moore said he will be encouraging people to wear masks for the coming months in an effort to reduce the transmission of the virus. Ontario was set to stay in Step 3 for at least 21 days and until 80 per cent of those eligible, aged 12 and older, have at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 75 per cent are fully immunized with both doses. After meeting those thresholds, the provincial government will reportedly look at removing the majority of public health and workplace safety measures. These measures include lifting capacity limits for indoor and outdoor settings and lifting social gatherings. Officials noted only a small number of measures will remain in place such as passive screening such as signage and businesses needing a safety plan. However, the shift to an earlier date appeared to differ from what Moore previously indicated in terms of his preference for moving into Step 3. Under the three-step plan released on May 20, a minimum period of three weeks will be in place before Step 3 could come into effect. Based on the previously published criteria, the earliest Ontario was set to enter Step 3 would have been July 21. During his first news conference, Moore said he expected the province would remain in Step 2 for at least three weeks due to concerns about COVID-19 variants. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWith Delta being present, we obviously have to watch what is going on around the world where Australia and multiple cities have had to lockdown, Israel is back with masking in public spaces, Europe might be looking at further public health measures,\u201d he said, noting the two-to-three-week intervals are important. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be watching internationally, nationally, provincially, locally \u2014 being data-driven and advise government based on data.\u201d In terms of the vaccination guidelines set out for Step 3 (between 70 and 80 per cent of eligible adults receiving their first vaccine dose and 25 per cent receiving their second dose), those thresholds have since been met. On Friday, officials reported first dose vaccine coverage of eligible adults stood at 78.9 per cent, and 52.7 per cent of adults received both doses. Moore was pressed about possibly accelerating the move into Step 3. However, he reiterated past government messaging and said reduced hospitalizations, ICUs as well as the level of virus spread and its associated reproduction rate are factors in the decision to leave Step 2 behind (the exact thresholds for each of those data metrics weren\u2019t released). \u201cAll of those metrics, together with Ontarians coming forward with having a high rate of immunization, gives me hope that we can open safely,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe will continue to monitor all the data as we move into Step 3.\u201d Premier Doug Ford made comments on Friday at an unrelated event in Brampton celebrating the earlier move to the next step due to high rates of immunization. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cI won\u2019t stop until we get every business open and back on their feet,\u201d Ford said.  \u201cAnd the only way we\u2019re gonna do that is to get vaccinated. We\u2019ll hit our target.\u201d Ford was questioned about the remaining 20 per cent who are unvaccinated and how that will impact reopening timelines and staying open. He said he can\u2019t force Ontarians to get the shot as \u201cthat\u2019s their constitutional right. I can\u2019t force anyone to get it. I encourage them.\u201d \u201cI would love to see 100 per cent but 80 per cent of a population of 15 million, that\u2019s pretty good. But I\u2019m never happy until we hit 100 per cent,\u201d Ford said. Minutes after the Ontario government made the announcement, the president and CEO of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business welcomed the changes. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cFinally, finally, finally small businesses have some light at the end of the tunnel. The world\u2019s longest lock down will come to an end next week,\u201d Dan Kelly told Global News Radio 640 Toronto. \u201cIt is so, so long overdue and really is some solid good news for small business owners across Ontario. However, despite the changes, Kelly said the province is still behind other provinces such as Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia for reopening, highlighting indoor capacity limits for instance. \u201cWe\u2019re still way, way behind. Most indoor activities will come along with a 50 per cent capacity restriction,\u201d he said. \u201cFor many, that will mean they are just not profitable any time soon. But still, we\u2019ve got to welcome today\u2019s news.\u201d Kelly said he is looking for additional transitional support payments from the Ontario government to help businesses that have incurred debt as a result of COVID-19-related measures. Toronto Mayor John Tory issued a statement Friday afternoon praising the provincial decision. \u201cI support this decision, based as it is on the advice of health officials, and believe it is the right thing to do as we continue to see lower case counts and higher vaccine rates. It makes continued progress on vaccinations more important than ever,\u201d he wrote, adding it giving business owners clear guidance for operating.  \u201cAs we review the regulations and the impacts of these changes on City services, we will be working to implement the new regulations as quickly as possible.\u201d"},

The province said Tuesday the restrictions, put in place to curb rising case numbers over the May long weekend, will be extended until Saturday. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t They were originally set to expire Wednesday. The restrictions include a ban on gathering with people outside a household and allow for only one person from each household to go into a business, with some exceptions for single parents and those needing a caregiver. \u201cOur health-care system is facing critical pressures, our health-care workers are strained and our public health orders provide clear direction on how to prevent further spread of this deadly virus,\u201d said Manitoba\u2019s chief public health officer, Dr. Brent Roussin. \u201cEven if we see case numbers decrease, the hospitalization and ICU numbers are expected to climb in the coming days and weeks which is concerning for all of us. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cIt is crucial that Manitobans continue to follow the public orders and significantly limit their close contacts to we can protect our health-care system and the Manitobans that are depending on it.\u201d Manitoba\u00a0has had the highest per-capita rate of new COVID-19 infections in Canada this month. Health officials reported 259 new cases Tuesday, down from a peak of 603 last week, and two deaths. The latest victims include a man in his 30s from the Winnipeg Health region and a woman in her 80s from the Southern Health region linked to the   first identified in the United Kingdom. Weeks of high daily COVID-19 numbers have stretched Manitoba\u2019s health-care system to the brink. As of Tuesday 23 critically-ill COVID-19 patients have had to be transferred for care in Ontario to protect provincial ICU capacity. On Tuesday half a dozen doctors called on the Progressive Conservative government to close non-essential businesses and enact a stay-at-home order. The surge of COVID-19 patients and the need to reassign health-care workers have resulted in cancelled surgeries and backlogs in other areas of medical care, they said. One of the physicians who works in intensive care, Dr. Eric Jacobsohn, said six people have died while waiting for cardiac surgery during the pandemic\u2019s third wave. Roussin did not rule out stricter public health orders, but said there is little interaction allowed between people under the current rules. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t A ban on indoor public gatherings and a 10 per cent limit on capacity at stores have been in place for three weeks. Restaurants have been restricted to takeout and delivery, while gyms and hair salons have had to close. Schools in Winnipeg, Brandon and some other areas have moved to remote learning. As of Tuesday morning, Manitoba\u2019s ICU beds were filled with 126 patients, including 79 connected to COVID-19, according to provincial health data. Manitoba\u2019s chief nursing officer, Lanette Siragusa, said with nursing staff redeployments stemming from a further shutdown of surgeries starting Tuesday, the province\u2019s ICU capacity now sits at 146. She said the province saw 12 COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU on Monday alone. May Long Weekend Public Heath Orders Extended to Protect Manitobans and the Health-Care System    \u2014 Manitoba Gov News (@MBGovNews)  There are also 314 patients in Manitoba\u2019s hospital\u2019s connected to the virus, health officials said Tuesday. During a briefing with media earlier in the day Tuesday health officials said Manitoba is also working on deals to send ICU patients to Saskatchewan and North Dakota, and the first patient is expected to arrive in Saskatchewan Wednesday, health officials in that province said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Ontario health officials have previously said the province can take as many as 20 ICU patents from Manitoba. Dr. Perry Gray, provincial lead, medical specialist services and chief medical officer with Manitoba Shared Health, couldn\u2019t say exactly how many patients Saskatchewan and North Dakota may be able to take, but he did say it\u2019s likely fewer than Ontario. Later in the day a Saskatchewan health official said the province could take as many as five Manitoba patients. Gray also said the province is looking at sending some patients requiring surgery, including cardiac and certain spinal surgeries, out of province for the procedures. Meanwhile the federal government has announced it will send health workers and other supports to Manitoba, including medical staff through the Canadian Red Cross as well as military help. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t It\u2019s also prepared to deploy epidemiologists, lab technicians and other supports. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Tuesday Ottawa will send federal workers and is also talking to the Canadian Red Cross about more help from them. The military is already in Manitoba helping with vaccinations in 23 First Nations, but is working with Manitoba to assess additional needs, a military spokesman said. Federal officials were not quick to explain details of how many and what type of workers are specifically is being offered. Pallister said he thinks a dozen critical care nurses are being deployed first, with the potential for up to 50.

Vitamin D is well-known for its role in keeping bones, teeth and muscles healthy by promoting the body\u2019s absorption of calcium. It is also critical for the proper functioning of our immune system, which protects the body from viruses and bacteria. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Over the past year,   have looked at the impact vitamin D levels and supplements could have on COVID-19 illness. While the data is promising, most experts say it is inconclusive. \u201cThe association between vitamin D and COVID-19 is intriguing, but to date it\u2019s not clear what that association means,\u201d said Donald Vinh, an infectious disease specialist and a medical microbiologist at the McGill University Health Centre. A new study done in Chicago of more than 4,000 people found that the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 was  . This research was published in the medical journal JAMA Network Open last week. In October 2020, a small-scale study of   suggested that more than 80 per cent had a vitamin D deficiency. Another small study of 129 COVID-19 patients in New York   that supplementation may prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes, such as death and mechanical ventilation, in patients with lower levels of vitamin D. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t That study was presented virtually at the   on March 20, but is yet to be peer-reviewed and published. Basically the lower the vitamin D level, more specifically 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the higher the risk that you might have COVID-19,\u201d said Sweta Chekuri, study co-author and assistant professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. However, Vinh is not convinced whether the emerging data points to a causal relationship \u2013 with a cause and effect \u2013 between the two. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any strong, compelling evidence that what we see with vitamin D levels in the blood necessarily means anything biologically for the (COVID-19) disease,\u201d he told Global News. \u00a0has authorized two drugs for treating COVID-19 \u2014\u00a0 \u00a0and\u00a0 \u00a0\u2014 while a number of   are also being used and experimented with as part of clinical trials across the country. There is currently no guidance on the use of micronutrient supplements, such as vitamins D and C and zinc, as a treatment for COVID-19, according to the  . In February,   showed that among the 240 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, a single high dose of vitamin D did not significantly reduce the length of stay in the hospital. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In any case, Sarah Baron, a physician and hospitalist at Montefiore Health System in New York, recommends giving supplements to patients with known low levels of vitamin D. \u201cIt not only may help with their bone health, maybe it will help with COVID-19 too,\u201d she said. Despite its role in boosting immunity, vitamin D is \u201cnot a body armour against COVID-19,\u201d said Richard Bazinet, a professor in the department of nutritional sciences at the University of Toronto. \u201cI think we should be cautious about getting too excited about this.\u201d Bazinet said an argument could also be made for a reverse causation, meaning it\u2019s actually the worse COVID-19 outcome that is causing the lowering of the vitamin D levels. \u201cPeople get sick, they stay in their house, they don\u2019t eat very well, they\u2019re out of the sunlight \u2014 and then the sicker people come into the hospital and do worse,\u201d Bazinet explained. Sun exposure is considered the best natural source of vitamin D. There is optimism that the onset of spring and sunny weather in Canada and other parts of the northern hemisphere could see a decline in COVID-19 cases. As is the case with the flu season, studies suggest that respiratory droplets that transmit COVID-19 tend to survive longer in cold, dry air and low humidity. So there is a slightly higher risk of getting COVID-19 outdoors in winter than spring or summer, experts say. But rather than the change in weather, our human behaviour with people spending more time outdoors, where there is better air circulation, will play a role in curbing the spread, said Vinh. The ultraviolet (UV) light from the sun also has a sterilizing effect on the novel coronavirus. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThe change in season is going to bring down the rates of coronavirus for several reasons, but I don\u2019t think any of them are going to be directly related to vitamin D levels,\u201d he said. Being deficient in vitamin D has its  , including bone weakness (osteoporosis) in adults and a similar bone deformity illness, called rickets, in children.  is also a concern. The recommended daily intake for most adults is 600 IU. Too much vitamin D raises the level of calcium in your blood, which can cause nausea, vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness and weight loss. Vitamin D toxicity can also lead to kidney problems and bone pain."},

The majority of the news cases \u2014 66 of them \u2014 are in Central Zone. Seventeen are in Eastern Zone, five in Northern Zone and three in Western Zone. At a briefing with Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Robert Strang, Premier Iain Rankin pointed out 17 of the new cases are in the Sydney area. \u201cThe fluctuation in case numbers in Sydney is an indication the variants are on the move in different parts of our province,\u201d Rankin said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Meanwhile, two more patients in a non-COVID unit at the Halifax Infirmary site of the QEII Health Sciences Centre have tested positive, and have been transferred to the COVID-19 unit. Staff and doctors who worked in that unit are being tested. According to Dr. Brendan Carr, the CEO and President of the Nova Scotia Health Authority, the outbreak in that unit now involves 12 patients and four staff members. \u00a0He says the hospital is taking enhanced precautions to prevent further spread. Carr added that all patients are tested when being admitted to the hospital. However, he says, it\u2019s possible someone could have been tested after being exposed to the virus, but before being COVID-19 positive. \u201cWe don\u2019t yet know the source of the infection but given the high prevalence of COVID-19 in our province, the likelihood of COVID-19 infections among admitted patients is higher now than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d he said. He says they are now retesting all patients at the Halifax Infirmary and Victoria General site of the QEII Health Sciences Centre. The hospital is also preparing for an influx of COVID-19 patients, including those who require intensive care. \u201cWe\u2019ve initiated a provincewide response, which means staff and other resources are being redirected and redeployed to greatest areas of need,\u201d he explained. The response means surgeries and procedures will be reduced temporarily, to ensure the hospital has the capacity to deal with all COVID-19 cases. There are 1,435 active cases in the province, while 95 people are in hospital, including 21 in ICU. The province reiterated there is community spread in Central Zone, as well as \u201careas of concern\u201d including Sydney, Bridgewater, and the Annapolis Valley from New Minas to Kentville. The province opened up Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to people 30 and older Monday morning. Rankin says the province expects to have all eligible groups open by next week. As of Sunday, 430,856 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered. Of those, 39,235 Nova Scotians have received their second dose. As well, the idea of New England states sharing their extra vaccines with eastern Canadian provinces was recently discussed during a meeting between the governors and premiers. According to Nova Scotia, the New England states have indicated they have a \u201csignificant percentage\u201d of their population vaccinated and they are \u201cwilling to share their excess vaccine as a way of expediting the reopening of borders and the recovery that can follow once that happens.\u201d The governors and premiers will be sending a joint letter to the American and Canadian governments to facilitate \u201creceipt of the extra vaccine and their work in reopening the border.\u201d Strang says the uptake in vaccination among older Nova Scotians has been high, and he hopes to see younger populations do the same. He adds, in his opinion, the province will need to see 75 per cent of the population vaccinated \u2014 not just 75 per cent of those eligible \u2014 in order to ramp down restrictions that have been in place for over a year now. \u201cSeventy-five per cent is our magic number,\u201d he said. Currently, 40 per cent of the population has received one or both doses of a vaccine. \u201cThe virus needs a large population of unvaccinated people to spread we cannot give it that opportunity,\u201d Strang said. \u201cAnybody eligible must do their part and get vaccinated.\u201c In an update form Nova Scotia Health, there are now 40 confirmed COVID-19 cases among staff, with 15 of those considered active.

Starting Thursday, close contacts will no longer be notified of exposure by contact tracers nor will they be legally required to isolate \u2014 although it still recommended. The province will also end asymptomatic testing. Further measures will be eliminated Aug. 16. People who test positive for the virus will not be mandated to isolate at that time but it is still strongly recommended.

The changes are being made, in part, to better manage public health resources, Dr. Deena Hinshaw explained on Wednesday. \u201cCOVID is not over\u2026 COVID will not be eliminated. We need to learn to live with it. \u201cCOVID is not the only threat that we\u2019re facing,\u201d Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health added. On Wednesday, Alberta identified 194 new COVID-19 cases out of about 7,100 tests. Alberta\u2019s positivity sat at about 2.9 per cent. There were 84 Albertans in hospital with COVID-19, including 18 in ICU. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t As of Wednesday, Alberta had 1,334 active cases. \u201cCases have risen recently, almost entirely in those who have not yet been vaccinated, as we expected would happen as people are in close contact with one another,\u201d Hinshaw said. Since July 1, people who were not immunized made up 95 per cent of confirmed cases, 92 per cent of those requiring hospital care and 95 per cent of COVID-19 deaths, she said. Still, hospitalizations continue to decline. \u201cWhile COVID cases may rise\u2026 a surge in hospital admission and severe outcomes is much less likely thanks to vaccines,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cHaving two doses of COVID vaccine has never been more important.\u201d In terms of key metrics, she said case numbers are less important than the rates of hospitalization and severe COVID-19 cases. If you\u2019re 20-39 & think you aren\u2019t at risk, 1400+ ABs your age have needed hospital care over the last 17 months & 200 ICU care. If you haven\u2019t gotten both doses yet, this is the time. Vaccines will protect you, those around you & will keep AB safer in the months ahead. (14/14) \u2014 Dr. Deena Hinshaw (@CMOH_Alberta)  In a few steps \u2014 July 29, Aug. 16 and Aug. 31 \u2014 Alberta will make changes to make sure it\u2019s ready to care for all patients, including those with COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses, like influenza, which Hinshaw said are expected to increase late this summer and into fall. Testing for severe COVID-19 cases, provincial monitoring, outbreak management in high-risk settings, and other key measures will remain in place. Health officials will be able to adapt as needed if hospitalizations due to COVID-19 spike, the province said. \u201cOur health system will keep protecting Albertans who are exposed to COVID-19 while also ensuring that we are able to handle all other viruses and illnesses,\u201d Health Minister Tyler Shandro said. \u201cAs the majority of us are vaccinated against COVID-19, we are adapting to make sure that the health system is ready to care for all Albertans, whatever their illness.\u201d \u2013 Quarantine for close contacts will shift from mandatory to recommended. Isolation for anyone with COVID-19 symptoms and for confirmed positive cases is still required. \u2013 Unimmunized individuals who know they have been exposed to COVID-19 should monitor for symptoms and seek testing if they become symptomatic. \u2013 Anyone who is not fully immunized should avoid high-risk locations such as continuing care facilities and crowded indoor spaces if they have been in contact with a case in the past 14 days. \u2013 All positive cases will continue to be notified. Contact tracers will no longer notify close contacts of exposure. Individuals are asked to inform their close contacts when informed of their positive result. \u2013 Contact tracers will continue to investigate cases that are in high-risk settings such as acute and continuing care facilities. \u2013 Outbreak management and identification will focus on high-risk locations, including continuing and acute care facilities and high-risk workplaces. Community outbreaks with a surge in cases leading to severe outcomes will also be addressed as needed. \u2013 Asymptomatic testing is no longer recommended. Testing will continue to be available for individuals who are symptomatic. \u2013 Mandatory masking remains in acute and continuing care facilities, publicly accessible transit, taxis and ride-share. \u201cOver the next two weeks, we will closely monitor these changes and adapt as needed,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u2013 Provincial mandatory masking orders will be lifted. Some masking in acute care or continuing care facilities may still be required. \u2013 Isolation following a positive COVID-19 test result will no longer be required, but strongly recommended. \u2013 Individuals with symptoms of any respiratory infection should still remain at home until symptoms have resolved. \u2013 Staying home when sick remains an important way to care for those around us by not passing on any infection. \u2013 Isolation hotels and quarantine support will no longer be available. \u2013 Testing will be available for Albertans with symptoms when it is needed to help direct patient care decisions. \u2013 This testing will be available through assessment centres until Aug. 31 and, after that, will be in primary care settings including physicians\u2019 offices. For those with severe illness requiring urgent or emergency care, testing will be available in acute care and hospital settings. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u2013 COVID-19 testing will also be offered as needed in high-risk outbreaks such as in continuing care facilities. \u2013 Public health will focus on investigating severe cases that require hospitalization and any deaths due to COVID-19. \u2013 Outbreak management and preventative measures will continue focusing on outbreaks in high-risk settings, such as continuing and acute care facilities. \u2013 Community outbreaks will continue to be addressed as needed. \u2013 Daycares and schools will be supported with measures that would be effective for any respiratory virus if outbreaks are identified. \u2013 COVID-19 testing will no longer be available through assessment centres. It will be available in primary care settings including doctors\u2019 offices or in acute care and hospital settings. \u2013 Universal masking will not be required in schools once students return. However, it is recommended as a temporary outbreak intervention in response to respiratory outbreaks. A guidance document to support return to schools is being finalized and will be released in mid-August. \u201cOur top priority is supporting the health of Albertans,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cCOVID-19 is still with us but we are now in a place where we need to manage it through vaccinations and the proven public health measures used for other communicable viruses. \u201cWe expect to see increased influenza and other viruses this year, and these changes will make sure the health system is ready and able to support all Albertans in the months ahead.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u00a0 Dr. Craig Jenne, an infectious disease expert at the University of Calgary, said it\u2019s good to see hospitalizations and intensive care unit admissions decline but noted that they are lagging indicators. \u201cWe have the fewest protected people and yet also the fewest public health guidelines to help limit that spread if an outbreak begins,\u201d he said Tuesday, referring to Alberta\u2019s lower vaccination rate compared to other provinces. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t guarantee that we\u2019re going to see a dramatic rise in cases, but it absolutely creates the potential for rapid and sustained viral spread.\u201d If the numbers were to change, he said, the province would need to consider reintroducing some public health restrictions. Hinshaw said further action would be considered if Alberta sees a surge in cases in a localized area leading to severe outcomes or if a variant strain arrives that doesn\u2019t respond to the vaccines.  said he was surprised the province decided to lift more public health restrictions when Alberta was seeing a rise in cases and variants. Iveson said the city is monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely and council will discuss any changes to the local response on Aug. 12. \u201cWe need more Edmontonians to get vaccinated so that we can protect ourselves and our communities. \u201cUnvaccinated people account for the majority of new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the province,\u201d he said in a  \u201cI am really pleased to see so many Edmontonians choosing to wear masks in grocery stores and other public environments \u2014 this helps to protect loved ones who cannot yet get vaccinated, like our children under 12. \u201cIf you feel safer wearing a mask in crowded public areas or wish to maintain some degree of physical distance, please do so. I encourage others to give neighbours the time, space and room to do that free of judgement.\u201d This was the first time Hinshaw had a news conference since her regular COVID-19 updates stopped one month ago. On June 29, she urged Albertans to continue to make \u201csafe choices\u201d after restrictions are lifted. Hinshaw also encouraged people to get vaccinated, continue with good hand hygiene and weigh the benefits vs. the rewards of activities. Most of Alberta\u2019s public health restrictions lifted on July 1. Since then, bars and restaurants have been welcoming customers back without mandatory capacity limits or masks and events like the Calgary Stampede went ahead. In mid-July, Alberta\u2019s active case numbers started going up. On July 14, there were 569 active COVID-19 cases in the province; by July 22, there were 676; and on July 27, there were 1,173 active cases. Alberta\u2019s positivity rate has also been rising. It was 0.68 per cent on July 14, 1.09 per cent on July 22 and 1.99 per cent on July 27. The R value \u2014 or reproductive/transmission rate \u2014 has also been going up. It was 0.84 the week of July 14. The latest R value \u2014 released July 26 \u2014 was 1.48 for Alberta. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t However, hospitalizations and ICU admissions due to COVID-19 have continued to slowly decline. On June 14, there were 113 Albertans in hospital, including 33 in ICU; on July 22, there were 93 people in hospital with COVID-19, including 26 in ICU; and on July 27, there were 82 people in hospital, including 21 in ICU. So far, 75.5 percent of Albertans 12 and older have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine and 63.9 per cent are fully vaccinated. Dr. Jia Hu, a medical officer of health with AHS for the Calgary zone, said Wednesday he\u2019s pleased with Canada\u2019s vaccination rates so far. \u201cI am feeling pretty good. Things that I would not have expected eight months ago is Canada being the global leader in vaccination uptake, that\u2019s really nice. \u201cI generally feel good about the summers here. Last summer, when nobody was immunized, we didn\u2019t have too many cases,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next time we will be challenged, if we are, will be the fall.\u201d Hu said the numbers reinforce the need for people to be immunized. \u201cAcross Canada and the U.S., 95-99 per cent of people in hospitals have not been vaccinated. If you\u2019ve been vaccinated, it\u2019s very, very, very unlikely you\u2019ll end up with any bad outcomes.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Hu, who also served as Calgary Stampede\u2019s medical director, expected to see an uptake in cases when Alberta reopened July 1. \u201cThe question is what the magnitude will be. Obviously, it\u2019s something we want to keep an eye on, something we can use to encourage people to get vaccinated for. \u201cBut you know, I think if the cases tend to be in younger people, the infection is milder, hopefully they\u2019ve had at least one dose of vaccine, the number of severe cases hopefully won\u2019t go up too much,\u201d Hu said. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to get rid of COVID; we\u2019re going to live with it and try to balance a certain amount of reopening with a certain amount of COVID cases. \u201cIf we see an increase in cases \u2014 which no doubt we do \u2014 but we don\u2019t see as much in terms of severe COVID, I think that\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d Dr. Daniel Gregson, a physician, infectious disease expert and associate professor at the Cumming School of Medicine, agrees opening up means more transmission. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe\u2019re having a bit of a bump right now, and if the numbers continue to increase, it\u2019ll migrate into a full wave, similar to what they\u2019re seeing in the U.K\u2026 Hopefully that will not translate into as many admissions and deaths that we\u2019ve seen in previous waves. \u201cThe only thing we have going for us now is that really this transmission is occurring primarily in a younger population than our previous waves,\u201d he said. Fewer than half of Albertans ages 20-29 are fully vaccinated, a number we need to increase. Vaccines save lives & even younger Albertans need the protection that comes with getting vaccinated. Encourage Albertans under 30 to sign up at  . (4/4) \u2014 Dr. Deena Hinshaw (@CMOH_Alberta)  But it remains to be seen if the increasing case numbers will lead to increases in hospitalizations, Gregson said. \u201cThe question we have really is: how much activity can we tolerate? And how much burden can we put on the health system?\u201d He believes Canada\u2019s experience could be somewhere in the middle of what the U.K. and Israel have seen, \u201cwith some increase in our hospitalizations, if not through the summer than in the fall. I guess the important thing is it\u2019s going to be in people who are not immunized and that\u2019s a fixable problem.\u201d"},

Premier Jason Kenney announced further details Monday afternoon about the province\u2019s Open for Summer Lottery, which will hand out three separate $1-million prizes this summer. \u201cNow your vaccine shot is also your shot at becoming a millionaire,\u201d Kenney said outside the Edmonton Expo Centre Monday. Over the weekend, the premier took to social media to share some details about the province-wide lottery. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The first $1-million prize is up for grabs to any Albertan 18 or older who gets at least their first dose of vaccine. Registration will close one week after the province immunizes 70 per cent of the eligible population with one dose. As of Sunday night, Kenney said 68.7 per cent of eligible Albertans had received their first dose. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Eligibility criteria are as follows: The province said anyone 18 and older who received their first dose outside the province is also eligible, as long as they submit proof of vaccination to Alberta Health Services and meet the other criteria. Eligible Albertans can now register for the lottery  . The province said people have to opt into the vaccine lottery to comply with Alberta\u2019s privacy legislation. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The winner of the first $1 million will be announced when   begins. The other two $1-million lotteries will be held throughout the summer. Kenney said the second $1-million prize will be handed out in August to anyone 18 and older who is fully vaccinated with two doses. The third prize will be handed out in late September, also for those 18 and older who are double-dosed with COVID-19 vaccine. The province said people will only need to enter once for all three draws. Proof of vaccination will be required once a winner is selected. Health Minister Tyler Shandro said more incentives are being explored for Albertans aged 12 to 17 who are not eligible for the lotteries. Details on those incentives will be announced in the coming days, he said. \u201cWe are spending this money to ensure widespread immunity that benefits every Albertan,\u201d Shandro said Monday. Dr. Noel Gibney, co-chair of the Edmonton Zone Medical Staff Association\u2019s Strategic COVID-19 Pandemic Committee, said he hopes the lottery will reach those who have been on the fence about vaccination. The doctor hopes the lottery will be repeated in August to encourage people to get their second doses. This will provide better protection against the Delta variant and avoid a fourth wave, he explained. \u201cIt really is important that they put as much effort into getting people their second doses, as they are now putting, appropriately, into the first doses.\u201d Dr. Bradley Ruffle is the academic director of the McMaster Decision Science Laboratory at McMaster University. He said overall, the lottery is not a bad idea to get people to roll up their sleeves, but added it\u2019s not the best way to push up vaccination rates. \u201cI think it\u2019s a decent idea. As an economist, I certainly believe that financial incentives can change people\u2019s behaviour, but I think it\u2019s about the fifth-best idea you can think of to increase vaccination rates.\u201d He said the best idea would have been an opt-out option much earlier in the vaccination rollout. \u201cWhen the vaccines were first developed and while we were still waiting for them to be approved by Health Canada, the government already starts to begin booking appointments for every adult Canadian. So you get a phone call or a letter telling you to go to such and such a place on a specified date and time to get your first vaccine dose. You, of course, have the option to cancel your appointment if you really don\u2019t want to go, but that, of course, requires some effort,\u201d Ruffle explained in an interview with Shaye Ganam on 630 CHED Monday morning. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect it to work on the anti-vaxxers who have the strong ideology, but those who are on the fence or those who are just disorganized and can\u2019t get their act together, maybe are confused, maybe don\u2019t know how to use the computer to book their appointment, you get it booked for you. \u201cThe idea here is just to make it easier. I think making it easier for people would be more effective than any of these financial incentives.\u201d If going the lottery route, Ruffle suggests making many smaller prizes so more people can benefit from the program. One example is offering 1,000 smaller prizes of $1,000. \u201cIt still totals up to the same $1 million in prizes, but it would be more effective. And the way to conduct such a lottery would be to have these 1,000 prizes at $1,000 each, having such a lottery every day, where, for instance, you announce 10 $1,000 prize winners publicly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be likely after a number of days that already just about every Albertan would know at least someone who has won one of these $1,000 prizes. \u201cIt makes the lottery more real, more salient. It\u2019s not this pie-in-the-sky, one chance in almost four million to win the big prize.\u201d Shandro said the province explored several options when it came to financial incentives, including having more smaller prizes. He said the province consulted with people who have experience designing lotteries, including Alberta Gaming, Liquor and Cannabis, and the recommendation was to have three prizes worth $1 million each. \u201cIf we had three prizes of $1 million each, then that was going to be enough for us to get enough folks to register for this lottery,\u201d Shandro said. \u201cWe did consult lottery experts and this is what they recommended,\u201d Kenney added. \u201cThe big prizes get more interest.\u201d NDP MLA David Shepherd said Kenney\u2019s original announcement of the lottery through a social media video on Saturday was \u201cbotched\u201d and caused confusion, but added the NDP caucus is supportive of any effort to increase the vaccination rate. \u201cA lottery is worth a try.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t As of June 12, 68.7 per cent of eligible Albertans 12 and older had received their first dose of vaccine. The province said as of June 13, there were 60,429 first-dose vaccine appointments booked in the next seven days. The province anticipates it will hit the 70 per cent threshold for first doses on June 18. This would trigger the start of Stage 3 of the province\u2019s reopening plan two weeks later on July 2. Kenney said Monday the province is about 48,361 first-dose appointments away from the 70 per cent threshold. To continue the push for people to get their first doses, the Edmonton Expo Centre is still offering walk-in vaccinations for people who need their first shot.\u00a0Walk-ins for those who have not yet received their first dose are available in Hall C during the following hours: Every Albertan 12 and older is eligible to receive their first dose. Anyone who received their first dose in April or earlier is now eligible to book their second dose of vaccine. Details on how to book vaccination appointments can be found on the  ."},

The ramped-up immunization drive kicked in days after the province gave the green light to start targeting residents of six public health units between the ages of 60 and 64. Family doctors were cleared to begin administering shots of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to eligible residents in Toronto, Peel Region, Hamilton, Guelph, Peterborough, and Simcoe-Muskoka. As he prepared to give 40 patients their shots, at least one doctor said the acceleration of the mass inoculation effort left him \u201cgiddy\u201d with excitement. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThis is what we do as family doctors,\u201d said Dr. Sohal Goyal, the lead physician of a family health group in Mississauga, Ont. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to finally be able to contribute. And hopefully, this will mean that all family doctors will be given the opportunity across the province.\u201d The doctors are currently set to receive a limited supply of roughly 29,500 vaccine doses, but officials have said that figure could increase as more vaccine shipments arrive in Canada. The Ontario Medical Association is asking residents to refrain from flooding doctors\u2019 offices with phone calls, saying that physicians will contact patients who are eligible to receive the vaccine. Still, Goyal said, his practice isn\u2019t turning away unsolicited callers, but putting them on a wait list instead. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe\u2019re trying to look at inventory versus accommodating everyone,\u201d said Goyal, board chair of the Mississauga Halton Primary Care Network. \u201cI just want to protect the community.\u201d Goyal said he hasn\u2019t encountered much hesitancy after reassuring patients that the AstraZeneca vaccine is both safe and effective, despite reports that some people in the European Union experienced blood clots after getting the shot. \u201cThe question is: Do you want to get it now, or do you want to wait?\u201d said Goyal, noting that immunization experts are urging Canadians to accept any vaccine they can get as soon as possible to reduce the burden COVID-19 places on the health-care system. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cIf you talk to patients that way, most of them understand it, and they\u2019re ready to go.\u201d Family doctors are well equipped to assist with the COVID-19 immunization campaign, delivering a large share of flu shots every season, Goyal said. Some primary care providers may face challenges integrating their COVID-19 vaccination duties into their already busy practices, he said. Public health protocols have made delivering care more complicated, and now staff will have to learn to navigate a new vaccine documentation system, he noted. Over the past week, Goyal said he\u2019d spent hours every night preparing to deliver his first batch of shots. For him, however, the extra effort was more than worthwhile. \u201cEach of these needles could potentially save a life,\u201d said Goyal, who lost his father to COVID-19 complications in January. \u201cThere\u2019s things we do on a daily basis that are challenging. And this is one where you\u2019re contributing directly to the health-care system and to these individual patients.

Ontario reported 1,468 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday, as well as 11 more deaths linked to the virus. Health Minister Christine Elliott said the latest count includes 381 new infections in Toronto, 226 in Peel and 168 in York Region. The province reports that 676 people are being treated for COVID-19 in hospital, including 282 patients in intensive care. Elliott said 1,116,496 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Ontario as of Friday evening."},

The new   uses letters from the Greek alphabet to identify the various variants, which up to this point have been identified with a clunky string of letters and numbers \u2014 or by the problematic convention of referring to the geographical origins of where they first emerged. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The WHO says it came up with the new labels after several months of discussion and criticism around some nations being stigmatized for identifying new strains. The organization has repeatedly urged people not to refer to the variants by profiling people or nationalities, especially in the wake of a surge in anti-Asian racism around the world. Nevertheless, some politicians, including former U.S. president  , have used terms such as \u201cthe China virus\u201d in order to smear rival nations. Certain countries have also been used as a shorthand to refer to the variants of concern, in lieu of their more awkward scientific designations. The variants will now have names that evoke late-season hurricanes or fraternities, rather than being referred to by a string of numbers or a country of origin. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWhile they have their advantages, these scientific names can be difficult to say and recall, and are prone to misreporting,\u201d the WHO said. \u201cNo country should be stigmatized for detecting and reporting variants,\u201d said WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove. Here\u2019s how the new names will be applied: The WHO has also applied letters to six variants of interest, and will continue to move through the 24-letter Greek alphabet as other variants emerge. The WHO considered using the names of Greek gods or pseudo-classical monikers, according to Mark Pallen, a bacteriologist who was involved in the talks. That approach was thrown out as many of those were already used as brand names. They also considered using the names of plants, fruits or lost religions but decided against it, the WHO said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Some scientists were already using bird names as unofficial terms for the variants, but that naming scheme was also dismissed amid fears that certain birds would be unfairly blamed for the variants. Some past diseases have been named for the locations where they were first identified, such as the Ebola virus, which is named for a river in Congo. Such names have proven to be problematic, as they have led to groups of people being stigmatized and unfairly blamed for diseases. \u2014 "},

It is clear that COVID-19 is spreading, and having an impact everywhere in our province.\u201d The impact on the healthcare system is of foremost concern for the province and Alberta Health Services (AHS). \u201cOur healthcare system is under significant stress, more than at any point during the pandemic,\u201d AHS president and CEO Dr. Verna Yiu said. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re currently experiencing several record highs across the healthcare system.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Yiu said the 186 COVID-19 patients currently in ICU beds is six times the record for influenza-related ICU admissions, and the 241 total patients being treated in ICUs is unprecedented. \u201cThat is easily the most ICU patients that we\u2019ve ever seen in our health-care system, and definitely higher than what we\u2019ve seen in waves one and two,\u201d Yiu said. \u201cWe also now have the highest number of patients on ventilators, at 222, of which more than half are COVID-19 patients,\u201d the AHS CEO said. Yiu said AHS is \u201ccarefully monitoring demand\u201d for ICU beds, and has the capacity to increase the total to 425 through repurposing other areas in hospitals for unstaffed beds. \u201cOur biggest current challenge though is staffing these additional spaces,\u201d Yiu said. \u201cAnd this is certainly more difficult than the first and second waves.\u201d Yiu said the conversion of other hospital spaces to unstaffed ICU beds has reduced capacity for surgeries \u2014 up to 30 per cent in some hospitals. She also said patients have had to be transferred from hospitals in communities like Fort McMurray, Lac La Biche, Grande Prairie, Cold Lake and St. Paul for care in Edmonton hospitals. \u201cAll of the 14 transfers were related to hospital capacity pressures, due to the COVID 19 pandemic response,\u201d Yiu said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Per capita case rates and hospitalizations have been higher than the province\u2019s two largest cities, Hinshaw said. \u201cSince the beginning of May, the North and Central zones have had higher hospitalization rates per capita compared to any other region of the province,\u201d the chief medical officer of health said. \u201cThe North Zone in particular, has had hospitalization rates more than double those of Edmonton, Calgary, or the South Zone.\u201d She added that since February, new cases in rural Alberta are 26 per cent more likely to end up in hospital. Kenney reiterated that vaccines are \u201cour way to get back to normal,\u201d announcing a new web tool to monitor vaccine uptake in areas throughout the province. \u201cSoon you\u2019ll be able to look up the percentage of individuals who have received at least one dose, the percentage of people fully immunized and the total doses that have been administered in your area by age group,\u201d the premier said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Kenney said later this week the province will \u201cpotentially\u201d be announcing a \u201crelaxation of self-isolation and quarantine requirements\u2026 based on whether they\u2019ve had a first- or second-dose of the vaccine \u2014 that will reflect the lower level of threat or the lower level of risk that they pose.\u201d He also said in the next day or two, half of Albertans eligible for their first shot will be getting it. While the premier hinted at lifting restrictions once a specified percentage \u2014 around 70 per cent \u2013 of the population got that first dose, he said the province will not be creating different rules for those vaccinated, since personal health information would need to be disclosed. \u201cThere\u2019s been a very clear direction set in this province that that kind of disclosure of personal health information will not be required of Albertans,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cAllowing more activity when people are fully vaccinated is going to be something we do as a population, and not as individuals.\u201d Hinshaw also announced a change to drive-in events. \u201cEffective today, anyone attending these events must attend only with members of their household in the same vehicle, or two close contacts for those who live alone.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Kenney responded to the recent announcement that the Calgary Stampede will have a more scaled-back, spaced-out event for 2021, calling it \u201cgreat news.\u201d \u201cBut how big a Stampede, how many of us can visit, and celebrate the \u2018Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth\u2019 \u2014 all of that depends on how many of us stick it to COVID by getting a vaccine.\u201d On Monday afternoon, Alberta Health announced 721 new COVID-19 cases, bringing active cases to 21,288 in the province. Hospitalizations rose to 678, with 181 in intensive care. With 7,002 tests conducted, the positivity rate remains above 10 per cent. Five more deaths due to COVID-19 were also announced, bringing the total to 2,148.

In an Instagram post on Monday, Cause and Effect kitchen and bar on Stone Church Road East said the alleged infected patron was at the business between 8 p.m. and midnight on Saturday, July 25. The bar\u2019s response to the episode was to hire a Hamilton company that says it\u2019s been \u2018bombarded\u2019 with calls since\u00a0  of the province\u2019s reopening plan. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cA month and a half ago, we were just getting bombarded with barbershops and hair salons,\u201d says Mazin Kulom of  \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get a lot of calls from daycare services recently right now and we are just getting tons of calls from bars and restaurants.\u201d Businesses typically associated with public gatherings, like bars, restaurants, and gyms have now been given the green light by Ontario to open as part of Stage 3 and that has kept partners Kulom and Peter Vlahic busy in recent weeks. The pair, who were showcased in an Instagram post this past week by Cause and Effect, says they\u2019ve been averaging 15 jobs a week spending roughly four to five hours per job cleaning businesses with a Pro Cordless Electrostatic Backpack Sprayer. \u00a0   A post shared by   (@causeandeffectbar) on  \u00a0 \u201cIt produces steam that\u2019s statically charged as the spray exits the nozzle and it has a positive electron,\u201d said Vlahic. \u201cThe spray instantly latches onto surfaces and doesn\u2019t create a solution that\u2019s airborne for people to breathe in.\u201d The electrostatic sprayer, manufactured by Victory Innovations Co., is an aerosol system several manufacturers have begun producing to more efficiently clean surfaces amid the pandemic. Vlahic and Kulom were in contact with the manufacturer prior to the pandemic to buy the sprayer as the key part of a forthcoming disinfection cleaning business. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in contact with them for about six to seven months, even prior to the pandemic happening, because we were going to get into the disinfecting field even before this,\u201d said Vlahic. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t However, the partners had to sit patiently for their order as the tool became a hot property when the pandemic struck. \u201cAnd the second that we made our order, somehow this pandemic ended up occurring, and the company sold out within a matter of minutes,\u201d Vlahic said. Bridget Hagan of Akhia Communications who works for the publicity firm that represents Victory Innovations says demand has certainly been high for the two models of electrostatic sprayers the company sells. \u201cThey have seen a great increase from industries that range from hospitals to athletic facilities and schools,\u201d Hagan said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re seeing a lot of that, as well as airports and retail stores.\u201d Public Health Ontario   whether electrostatic spraying is more effective than conventional surface disinfection methods for COVID-19, but the agency says it is likely with the application of a standardized solution of concentrated germicidal bleach the method would also disinfect coronaviruses. Clyde Coventry, a director with St. Joseph\u2019s environmental services department, says the hospital invested in two Clorox Total 360 Electrostatic Sprayers which are used an \u2018adjunct\u2019 to their main cleaning processes. \u201cIt\u2019s an electrostatic sprayer, would you plug in the wall,\u201d said Coventry. \u201cThere\u2019s a chemical that you put into the system, you plug the trigger and a wand charges the particles and sprays the chemical all over the surfaces.\u201d Coventry says the hospital invested in the sprayers between February and March as they begin seeing the rise of COVID-19 in North America. \u201cIt was introduced to me earlier in the year. We were looking at it. I wasn\u2019t going to buy one,\u201d Coventry said. \u201cI did purchase one as we started to see Asia and the pandemic start to spread.\u201d The units by no means figure into the hospital\u2019s primary method of cleaning as environmental services still relies heavily on fighting surface contaminants with a hydrogen peroxide disposable cloth technology which is applied by hand and air-dried. Coventry says what it is used for is an extra cleaning measure in the evening. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cSo areas like our assessment center where we are seeing high volumes of possible or potential patient traffic,\u201d said Coventry, \u201cWhat we do at the end of day when those areas are closed, we use the electrostatic sprayer as an additional disinfectant step.\u201d Richard MacDonald, Hamilton public health\u2019s manager of food and water safety, says the sprayers appear to be effective in limiting the spread of COVID-19 in a restaurant setting assuming Health Canada approved chlorine, ammonium, or iodine-based solutions are used and that the product\u2019s instructions are followed by the letter. However, MacDonald says in a food service business removing debris should be the first step before applying a sprayer. \u201cObviously warm water and soap are a really good as a start to lift and emulsify food particles or whatever is on the surface, and then apply the sanitizer for it to be the most effective plan,\u201d McDonald said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t On Friday, Hamilton\u2019s medical officer of health issued a letter to owners and operators of bars and restaurants in the city and reminded them of their \u2018responsibilities and requirements\u2019 with respect to public health. \u201cRestaurant and bar owners and operators have an obligation to ensure they are taking the proper measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, Dr. Elizabeth Richardson said in a statement. \u201cThis is particularly important given the cases and clusters resulting from bars and restaurants that have been reported in Canada and worldwide.\u201d Richardson went on to say physical distancing between tables, face coverings worn by staff and customers, keeping people seated and recording a log of customers were just a few of the obligations restaurants and bars have during the on-going pandemic. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Electrostatic\u2019s Kulom and Peter Vlahic say they\u2019ve made a significant investment in the sprayer not only for usage within\u2019 their cleaning service but to sell as well. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of updating our website right now to become more like a shopping site because we will be carrying the product,\u201d said Vlahic. \u00a0  can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing \u2014 very similar to a cold or flu.

In a statement posted on Thursday afternoon, the company expressed \u201cdeep sadness\u201d about the \u201cdevastating news\u201d that one of its employees with COVID-19 had passed away. It also said it was in touch with the family to offer condolences and that it was \u201cdedicated to providing the support and reassurance\u201d to help its employees cope with the tragedy. Maple Lodge also said in its statement that, like other companies, it continued to be \u201csignificantly challenged by the ever-evolving COVID-19 crisis. It added that it had contacted local public health officials immediately after each COVID-19 case was identified. The Maple Lodge plant is the latest meatpacking plant in North America to be struck by an outbreak of the new coronavirus. Global News   on Wednesday the chicken processing company waited nearly three weeks before publicly disclosing the first positive case. A letter to employees dated April 16, and obtained by Global News, indicated the company became aware on April 15 that an employee had tested positive for the virus. \u201cThe employee\u2019s last day worked was April 6,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIn accordance with Maple Lodge Farm\u2019s COVID-19 protocols they have been out of the workplace and in self-isolation since learning on that date, that their spouse had tested positive for the virus.\u201d \u201cThe employee at that time had no symptoms.\u201d The company publicly acknowledged the \u201cfirst positive cases\u201d in an earlier statement posted on May 4.

Global News has agreed not to identify the family members over fears of workplace reprisal. The spouse of one employee who is currently in isolation with a severe cough after being tested for COVID-19 said they are upset the company isn\u2019t taking enough steps to protect workers. \u201cThe way they are doing it is wrong,\u201d said the spouse. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they shutting down? Do a deep clean, have everyone isolate for two weeks and then return.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think Maple Lodge employees are their main priority,\u201d they told Global News. \u201cThey are looking for profit over people\u2019s health.\u201d When asked why it hadn\u2019t informed the public about the situation earlier, Carol Gardin, director of corporate affairs for Maple Lodge, told Global News in an email that the company was committed to communicating first and foremost with its employees and public health officials. \u201cAt this time, we are in the midst of communicating sensitive information to our employees, who remain our number one priority,\u201d Gardin wrote.

{"title": "Alberta investigating 2 separate COVID-19 outbreaks involving P.1 variants  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted April 5, 2021 4:30 pm", "body": "Alberta is currently investigating two separate, unrelated   outbreaks involving the P.1 variant, which was first discovered in Brazil. In a thread of tweets sent Monday afternoon, the province\u2019s chief medical officer of health provided more information about a \u201csignificant COVID-19 outbreak in Alberta involving P.1 variants of concern,\u201d which was originally tweeted about on Saturday. Dr. Deena Hinshaw said the outbreak appears to be linked to a large employer with multiple sites across Western Canada. The name of that employer was not released. Hinshaw said the outbreak started with a traveller who returned to Alberta from out of province. Where the person was returning from was not disclosed. \u201cTo date, the spread has been confined to three work sites in Central and North zone, where employees have travelled between sites,\u201d she said on Twitter. As of Monday, 26 cases of COVID-19 have been linked to employees at the three sites and their household contacts. Hinshaw said so far, three cases are confirmed to be P.1 cases \u201cbut this will likely increase as more results come in.\u201d \u201cAHS has been working with the operator and cases to ensure anyone at risk of exposure is offered testing and quarantines to limit the spread. This includes employees at other sites who may have been exposed,\u201d she tweeted. Anyone at risk is being contacted directly, Hinshaw said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Hinshaw also said a separate, unrelated P.1 outbreak has been reported at a workplace in the Calgary zone. The name of the site was not released. That outbreak currently includes five cases of COVID-19, including one confirmed case of the Brazilian variant, Hinshaw said. Health officials are also working with this employer and supporting anyone at risk. \u201cThanks for your patience,\u201d Hinshaw tweeted. \u201cThese investigations are complex and it\u2019s important that we ensure information is accurate and that anyone at risk is directly contacted before sharing details. We also must balance the public desire for info with protecting patient confidentiality.\u201d A government source confirmed to Global News that one of the outbreaks is linked to PTW Canada Ltd. On its website, the Calgary-based company says it provides \u201cfabrication, construction and maintenance services\u201d to customers. On Tuesday, PTW Canada Ltd. released a statement to Global News about the situation. The company confirmed three positive cases among employees involving the P.1 COVID-19 variant at its Drayton Valley, Edson and Hinton offices. \u201cOur thoughts are with our employees and their families at this time as our employees isolate and focus on their health and recovery,\u201d the statement reads in part. \u201cThe health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we live and work is our top priority. \u201cSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, PTW has put in place strict safety protocols that meet or exceed the guidelines established by Alberta Health Services.\u201d PTW Canada said that it has hired a third party to carry out a comprehensive review of what happened and continues to work with AHS and Alberta Occupational Health and Safety to ensure it is managing the situation as well as possible. The government source did not provide details about the other outbreak. Albertans first learned of the original outbreak through a post on Hinshaw\u2019s Twitter account Saturday, which stated health officials were \u201cinvestigating a significant COVID-19 outbreak in Alberta involving P.1 variants of concern.\u201d Despite requests from Global News on Saturday and Sunday, Alberta Health would not provide further information about the outbreak, including where it was located or how many people might be affected. A spokesperson for Alberta Health said the public health investigation was still underway and that more information would be provided on Monday. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Dr. James Talbot, who co-chairs the Edmonton Zone Medical Staff Association\u2019s pandemic committee, said he saw the tweet sent Saturday. While he understands it was important information to share, he said he was disappointed to see it wasn\u2019t followed up with more information. \u201cDuring the pandemic, being transparent about what\u2019s happening has been a big part of building up trust,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rise of the variants has shown that it\u2019s a bad strategy to allow the virus to be in control\u2026 Anything that you can do to keep the virus under control is a good idea. Giving people timely, accurate, useful information about the variants in the province is a big part of that.\u201d Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley said this instance is \u201cpart of a pattern that we\u2019ve seen where Albertans are not given all the information that they need to keep themselves safe.\u201d \u201cThe Brazilian variant is very dangerous and Albertans want to know where we\u2019ve seen that outbreak,\u201d she said Monday. \u201cSo certainly announcing it and then not giving any information worries a lot of people and I certainly very much hope that they will share that information with Albertans today.\u201d Dr. Darren Markland, an intensive care physician at Edmonton\u2019s Royal Alexandra Hospital, said the P.1 variant is thought to have spent a fair amount of time in an immunocompromised host and during that time, it refined itself and became \u201chighly efficient at getting into cells and infecting people.\u201d \u201cIt also became significantly more harmful because of its ability to rapidly infect a lot of cells in the human body,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a variant that spreads quickly.\u201d Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Alberta, said all of the variants of concern are about 1.2 to 2 times more transmissible than the wild-type virus. \u201cAt the end of the day, higher transmission is overall worse for everyone,\u201d she said Sunday. \u201cMore people infected, there\u2019s more people who will just, by odds, get severely ill. So it is a big concern in terms of spread in the community and (the) health-care system getting a big influx of younger people who need more supportive care.\u201d Last Thursday, Premier Jason Kenney said Alberta was \u201cnow in a significant new wave of COVID-19\u201d and that hospitalizations are expected to rise as a result. \u201cWe know with great certainty that we will have close to 500 COVID-19 patients in hospital just two weeks from now,\u201d he said, adding that number could grow to 1,000 people in a month. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Markland said hospitals are going to be \u201cvery, very busy,\u201d adding they\u2019re already seeing younger people coming into hospital who require \u201cincredibly high levels of support.\u201d \u201cWe have the facility to put people on lung bypass \u2014 heart-lung bypass \u2014 but it is a very limited resource and we\u2019re seeing people who are young and sick enough to require this resource,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cThat is something that we had some experience with in our second wave, but because younger and otherwise completely healthy people are coming in, we will likely have to be utilizing that technology more in this wave.\u201d So far, studies suggest that antibodies generated through vaccination with approved vaccines recognize these variants and offer some protection, though it is still being closely investigated. Saxinger said vaccine efficacy rates are going to be subject to change over the next while because studies are being conducted at different times, in different locations and in different populations. She added lab data suggests the vaccines approved for use in Canada will provide some protection against the P.1 variant. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have firm observed numbers in a community setting,\u201d she cautioned. \u201cThere are not a lot of direct studies on vaccine effectiveness in P.1, there are lab studies. Based on the lab studies, the vaccines that we have in Canada now do have still an ability to neutralize the virus in terms of the antibody response. So you can have a neutralizing antibody response. The response might be somewhat reduced compared to the wild-type but it is expected that it will still be protective.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t However, Markland warned there is still reason for caution until enough of the population has been vaccinated. \u201cThe vaccine story is a double-edged sword. First of all, it provides people a fair amount of confidence. Everyone right now likely has a family member or loved one who has received a vaccine, and combine that with a little bit of spring fever, you can see people becoming significantly more lax about their attitudes towards preventative health-care measures,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to repeat, this virus is highly infectious and is spreading exponentially and we are not vaccinating exponentially, so right now, the variants will win this race, and every person who dies as a result of any form of COVID is a preventable death.\u201d Simply put, Markland said the restrictions that are in place in Alberta right now are not enough to control the spread. \u201cThe brutal fact of the matter is, all we have to do is look to Ontario to see what our future is and that will be our future in seven to 10 days. Their ICUs are full, they\u2019re having to institute much more stringent measures,\u201d he said. Talbot believes the province needs to act to bring in more stringent measures to control and spread and large outbreaks, particularly when variants are concerned. He said the restrictions that were in place over the winter during the second wave \u201caren\u2019t going to be enough to bring the variant back under control.\u201d \u201cThey should be moving to more of a lockdown situation and that would work against both the Brazil variant and the U.K. variant,\u201d Talbot said Monday. \u201cReturning to no indoor dining and drinking would be a really good idea. Shutting down any kind of ability to have indoor events of any size and potentially moving to a lockdown situation where we go back to telling people, \u2018If you\u2019re going to go outside, stay outside but do not go into indoor spaces unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary.\u2019 \u201cEvery day that you delay putting in restrictions, every day that you have weaker-than-needed restrictions is a day lost to bring this under control.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Saxinger said in the past, Alberta has not seen transmission turn around significantly without putting additional restrictions in place. \u201cEven though a lot of people have been doing all the right things all the way along \u2014 which has kept us out of deeper trouble, I would have to say \u2014 we know that extra measures are very likely to be needed at this point. I would be actually looking for something to be changing over the next few, several days hopefully,\u201d she said. \u201cI would consider it quite important to get the restrictions right to try to keep this from taking off because getting behind on the transmission when we know it\u2019s a variant of concern, especially, is a real issue right now, especially as we\u2019re just trying to get through vaccine rollout. \u201cWe know what we need to do, we just have to do it better and very, very stringently for the next while.\u201d The Alberta NDP is calling on the province to reintroduce the public health restrictions that were in place on Jan. 18 to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t On Thursday, Kenney pleaded with Albertans to follow the public health rules and guidelines currently in place but stopped short of implementing new restrictions. He noted the province was looking at whether more targeted restrictions may be needed in the future. Hinshaw said Monday she is concerned about the rising cases, including variants, in Alberta. The province reported 887 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday, including 432 variants of concern. Variant cases now make up 39 per cent of all active cases of COVID-19 in Alberta. As of end of day April 4,   cases of the P.1 variant. Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health is scheduled to provide an in-person update on COVID-19 on Tuesday afternoon."},

Once you\u2019ve identified your symptoms, the app asks questions related to travel history, close contact with a confirmed case and whether you\u2019ve isolated or quarantined. From there, the site may ask whether you\u2019ve been tested or hospitalized for COVID-19 before asking for location-related information. That data is populated to an interactive map with either a purple or orange dot as a marker \u2014 one designating people who have reported COVID-19 symptoms, the other for people who reported taking an official test. Flatten.ca works similarly, but it isn\u2019t identical. The website was created by a group of Canadian engineering students who wanted to find a way to help after the pandemic put their academic year on hold. Users are also asked to fill out a form about symptoms and provide the first three digits of their postal code, which is then populated on a heat map to show the prevalence of possible cases in a community. What separates Flatten.ca is its ability to map regions that have a \u201chigh density of vulnerable potential COVID-19 cases,\u201d such as older Canadians or those who are immunocompromised, said Shrey Jain, a University of Toronto student and the president and director of Flatten.ca. It also maps potential high-risk cases, like an elderly person who reported symptoms. \u201cSelf-reporting is a way to streamline the data collection process. It\u2019s a lot faster as well,\u201d he told Global News. \u201cIt\u2019s still a great indication of where a hotbed might be before it actually becomes one. It\u2019s like an early detection model. But the more people who use it, the more powerful the tool becomes.\u201d These types of projects are an effective way to get a better reflection of the health and wellness of the country during COVID-19, said Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist based out of Toronto General Hospital, but he cautioned against seeing these tools as definitive. There\u2019s still going to be an \u201cunderappreciation\u201d of the spread in some regions, he said, so the crowdsourced data should be considered \u201ccomplementary tools\u201d in the overall fight against the virus. \u201cThere\u2019s no one perfect surveillance tool,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we think about surveillance, we have to appreciate the inherent strengths and weaknesses of each tool. We can\u2019t take any individual piece of information in isolation. We have to put it in a broader context to really have a better understanding. So when we add surveillance tools together, we can get that broader picture of the disease in Canada and how it\u2019s changed with time.\u201d Both COVID Near You and Flatten.ca are working toward collaborating with other such sites to share data and ultimately expand their reach. Over a single day, the number of Canadian users on COVID Near You jumped from 40,000 to over 250,000, and it\u2019s only increasing, Brownstein said. Nearly half a million Americans had self-reported on the site as of April 14. Flatten.ca had upwards of 400,000 users as of April 14. \u201cThe more submissions we get, the higher the value of the data,\u201d Brownstein said, adding that it\u2019s just as important to have healthy Canadians participate. \u201cWe need everyone because you need a denominator. You need people that are healthy to understand the population of people that could be reporting.\u201d"},

A   published Thursday from epidemiologists and experts across both Canada, U.S. and the U.K. found an overwhelming amount of evidence that the disease was spread through aerosols \u2014 tiny airborne particles that come from people\u2019s mouths when they breathe, talk or cough. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t According to University of Toronto Professor Dr. David Fisman, one of the authors of the study, the results of the report come as an important implication for experts and governments to consider more stringent measures public health control measures in indoor spaces. Public health guidance on the spread of COVID-19 has, for the most part, been widely focused on direct contact with others and transmission via water droplets. The evidence from Fisman and his colleagues\u2019 review, however, points to aerosols as potentially being the main mode of transmission for the virus. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of lines of evidence leading up to this final nail in the coffin of this contact droplet idea,\u201d said Fisman. \u201cAnd this is good news in a sense \u2014 it explains a lot about the epidemiology of this disease. \u201cThat explains why we have these huge explosive outbreaks in places like church choirs and karaoke bars and spin studios, where people are vocalizing and creating a lot of aerosols.\u201d New or refocused measures to address the spread include a focus on breathing fresh air either through ventilation or moving activities outside, said Fisman. Other measures could also include using more air cleaners equipped with HEPA filters or better respirators \u2014 particularly in high-risk, essential and healthcare workplaces \u2014 in order to prevent people from inhaling aerosols. Several of Fisman\u2019s co-authors on the paper also shared their thoughts on the evidence they found. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t University of Colorado professor Jose-Luis Jimenez cited several pieces of evidence he and his team used for the report on Twitter Saturday. \u201cTransmission is 20 times more efficient indoors than outdoors,\u201d wrote Jimenez, who cited a review from The Journal of Infectious Diseases. 13/ FOURTH LINE OF EV.: transmission is 20 times more efficient indoors than outdoors.  Same gravity indoors and outdoors, large droplets do the same in either (can't explain difference) Huge aerosol dilution outdoors vs. trapping indoors can explain it \u2014 Jose-Luis Jimenez (@jljcolorado)  Zeynep Tufekci. a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said that because the disease was \u201cpredominantly airborne,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean masks and social distancing were useless, but that now they have better ways at mitigating infections now that they have a stronger grasp on how the virus is transmitted. Why this really matters. This isn\u2019t quibbles at the margins. Its an incorrect paradigm being replaced. Some things overlap between the two, but not everything does and thus there will likely be many real changes going forward that affect *other* respiratory pathogens as well.  \u2014 zeynep tufekci (@zeynep)  According to Fisman, the issue of pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19 \u2014 how the virus is spread before a patient starts to exhibit symptoms \u2014 also \u201cstrongly implies\u201d aerosol. \u201cThe way this ties to pre-symptomatic transmission is you\u2019re not coughing when you\u2019re symptomatic by definition, right? You may feel well enough to go to your choir, practise at a karaoke bar and be singing \u2014 and that creates orders of magnitude more aerosol than just quiet breathing,\u201d he said. In January, hundreds of doctors, scientists and experts from across Canada all called for more aggressive measures to stop the airborne spread of COVID-19. In an open letter address to the country\u2019s top doctor, health minister and all of the provincial premiers and medical officers, the experts urged public health messaging to more strongly warn of the risks of being in enclosed spaces. They also called for more stringent inspections and upgrades of ventilation systems in areas like schools and long-term care homes, as well as essential institutions. The World Health Organization and Public Health Agency of Canada have recognized the possibility that COVID-19 can spread by aerosols, though those experts and doctors \u2014 including Fisman \u2014 have all said that Canada needs to be acting more proactively to prevent such spread."},

Dany Fortin, who is leading Canada\u2019s vaccine rollout. Canada is expected to receive 655,200 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine between May 17 and May 21. The reassurance comes after Ontario, Quebec, B.C., Alberta and New Brunswick have made the vaccine no longer available as a first dose due to supply concerns and the potential risk of a rare blood clotting reaction called vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Out of 2.3 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine administered in Canada to date, 28 suspected cases of VITT have been reported, according to the federal government. Canada\u2019s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) says the estimated risk of VITT is about one in 100,000 people. Last week, NACI said that the mRNA vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were \u201cpreferred\u201d over the AstraZeneca or the Johnson & Johnson shots. While few have received the second dose of AstraZeneca in Canada, in the U.K., about 4.4 million have done so. Of those, about four cases of blood clotting were reported. Data is still coming in as to the effects of mixing two different vaccines for first and second doses. Deputy Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Howard Njoo said Thursday that mixing vaccines could even provide a \u201cgreater\u201d immune response, providing \u201cbroader protection against COVID-19.\u201d Preliminary data from a University of Oxford study found that mixing the Pfizer-BioNtech and AstraZeneca vaccines is safe, but may increase the frequency of mild to moderate side effects. The symptoms, though, lasted for a few days at most and there were no hospitalizations. According to the study, 34 per cent of 110 participants who received a first dose of AstraZeneca and a second dose of Pfizer reported feverishness, compared to 10 per cent of 112 participants who had a first and second dose of AstraZeneca. However, the study used a four-week interval between doses, whereas most of Canada will use a 12-week interval. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Another concern is the effect of mixing a mRNA vaccine with one that does not use the new technology, such as the AstraZeneca vaccine, which chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam said Canada will be watching \u201cvery closely.\u201d Njoo said Canada will review data from the U.K. studies seek guidance from the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) before providing recommendations for a second dose for those who received a first dose of AstraZeneca. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau received a first dose of AstraZeneca and said he will take it as a second on the advice of his doctor, and Ontario Premier Doug Ford has expressed willingness to take it as a second dose as well."},

But the app requires users to have Apple or Android phones made in the last five years, and a relatively new operating system. Christopher Parsons, a senior research associate at Citizen Lab, part of the Munk School of Global Affairs and Policy, says that makes the app inaccessible for older Canadians and other marginalized groups. \u201cThe worst affected by (the pandemic) are Black, Indigenous, people of colour, people who often have a lower socio-economic bracket. Who\u2019s not going to be able to install the application? That same group \u2026 that\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said. Parsons says criticism should be directed at the federal government, not those who designed the app. He believes the technical aspects of the application, such as its ease of use and its performance in both official languages, has been done well. \u201cOn the technical end, the developers deserve to be congratulated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a failure of policy. The government should have seen this, I hope someone has, they should have predicted it, I hope someone has, and they should have done something to try and start fixing it.\u201d The issue of needing an app that works with older smartphones was known from the start, he added. For a contact tracing app to properly work, he said, it requires 65 to 80 per cent of all Canadians to use it. The current version of the app makes that impossible. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat referred questions about the technical requirements of the app to Google and Apple, but noted the application is only one tool to slow the spread of COVID-19. It did not address a question about a potential timeline for the issue to be fixed. Ontario NDP legislator Marit Stiles took to Twitter to share her parents\u2019 frustration in attempting to download the app. Stiles\u2019 parents, both in their 70s, tried to download the app on their older iPhones, but it didn\u2019t work. \u201cThey\u2019re so frustrated that they can\u2019t download the app, the app won\u2019t work on their phone,\u201d she said in an interview Sunday. \u201cThis kind of surprised me.\u201d Stiles said this raises some concerns about the accessibility for more vulnerable Canadians. \u201cI think everybody agrees the app isn\u2019t a bad idea,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know that elderly folks, seniors, new Canadians, racialized people are the most likely to contract or be affected by COVID-19 \u2026 then it might be a bit problematic that the app only works with the fanciest or priciest new phones.\u201d For now, the smart phone app is only linked to the Ontario health-care system, with the Atlantic provinces set to be the next provinces to link up.

As first reported by   and confirmed to Global News by a senior Ontario government source not authorized to speak publicly, the reopening could occur over a few months, with the first phase of the plan potentially beginning in days. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Among the earliest items that could be allowed to go ahead are certain outdoor activities (golf and tennis were specifically cited) and small outdoor gatherings. Other outdoor activities in larger settings with greater numbers of attendees weren\u2019t likely to be allowed for several more weeks. In a letter to Premier Doug Ford released by the Ontario Hospital Association Wednesday evening, the organization pushed the government to ensure low-transmission environments (such as uncrowded parks, golf courses, playgrounds and tennis courts) are opened first, followed by crowded outdoor environments (patio dining) and uncrowded, well-ventilated indoor environments (such as retail), and ending with crowded indoor environments (such as restaurants and gyms). \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cAs the third wave slowly eases, we are all looking forward to re-opening the province, but the speed and scope must be carefully considered.

Nearly 180,000 people worldwide have been infected and over 7,000 people have died, as of March 16. While the bulk of the cases and fatalities have been confined to  , the virus has its grips on many other countries, including Italy, Spain, France, the United States and Canada. The pandemic has infiltrated headlines and psyches for months,\u00a0but how did we get to where we are today? \u201cCoronavirus\u201d refers to a family of viruses that range from the common cold to more severe illnesses like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). The disease caused by the virus circulating now, formally named COVID-19, is a respiratory illness. It has symptoms very similar to the common cold but is considered the most dangerous for older people and those with pre-existing health conditions. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t A recent   out of China has suggested that there are  , one being more aggressive than the other, but it has not been determined definitively. It\u2019s believed the new virus started in a \u201cwet market\u201d in Wuhan, China, where, like many other markets in Asia, farmed and exotic animals are tied up or stacked in cages. Many are killed on-site to ensure freshness. The markets are considered breeding grounds for new and dangerous infections, health experts say, because the close contact between humans and live exotic animals makes it easier for viruses to jump between species. SARS originated from the  \u00a0in 2002. \u201cThis virus is closely related to known bat viruses. That\u2019s why it\u2019s believed to have originated from a bat,\u201d said Dr. Jeff Kwong, an epidemiologist and scientist with ICES and Public Health Ontario. \u201cIt then somehow got into another animal and then acquired the ability to infect humans. We call these sorts of infections zoonotic infections \u2014 they can infect multiple mammals and cross between species.\u201d Scientists have not yet determined exactly how the new coronavirus first infected humans, but Stanley Perlman, a coronavirus expert at the University of Iowa, said it likely unfolded in a chain of events. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Since bats were not sold at the Wuhan market where the virus is believed to have originated, it\u2019s likely another animal sold there was infected. \u201cIn this instance, we think that bats infected an intermediary host that served as the immediate source for the human infection,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we do not know if this is the case or, rather, if an unidentified bat coronavirus nearly identical to the human strain jumped directly to humans.\u201d However, he acknowledged there\u2019s still a lot unknown about the origin. \u201cThere are several bat coronaviruses that are theoretically able to infect humans and were predicted by some scientists as able to cross species to infect humans,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, this could happen again with another one of these bat coronaviruses.\u201d The virus has been spreading since late December. When it first broke out, it was mostly contained to China. Over the past three months, it has touched more than 100 countries and transformed Europe into its newest epicentre. Kwong said that while it may seem like it caught on quickly, it\u2019s likely its spread in North America that is drawing increased attention. \u201cIt\u2019s been in China for a number of months already. It\u2019s not the most contagious spread of infection \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of other diseases that are much more contagious \u2014 but because there\u2019s a lack of immunity in the population, we\u2019re seeing a widespread transmission,\u201d he said. While there is a test to identify the virus, and clinical studies underway for a cure, there is currently no vaccine to prevent an infection or a treatment for those infected. Kwong believes general global modernization played a role in the spread. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThere\u2019s been an increase in global travel since the last virus that sort of propagates things further and helps it proliferate, just by the fact more people are moving around,\u201d he said. A   released Monday in conjunction with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) suggests that the contagiousness of the virus is likely a result of a large number of undetected infections early on in the outbreak. Many of the undocumented infections were already circulating long before China and others moved to heighten control and travel measures in late January, the study found. \u201cThese undetected cases seem to have been less contagious than the detected ones,\u201d said Ashleigh Tuite, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto\u2019s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, who reviewed the study. \u201cBut because there were so many, their overall contribution to the spread was substantial.\u201d Without effective measures to slow down the spread, COVID-19 will spread for months, experts believe. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see many more cases in the coming months and even years,\u201d said Kwong. But whether this virus could make way for more severe ones in the future?

{"title": "When can you get your 2nd COVID-19 dose? Here\u2019s where the provinces stand - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted May 27, 2021 4:29 pm", "body": "Several Canadian provinces will be administering second doses of   vaccine earlier than expected, due to the high number of people who have received their first dose so far, and a big supply of vaccine. Most provinces so far have indicated they\u2019re looking at speeding up second shots, with a few already announcing concrete plans. \u201cEverything is trending in the right direction,\u201d said Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada\u2019s deputy chief public health officer, at a press conference on Thursday. He said provinces that can administer second shots sooner should \u2013 and some already are. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) had previously said doses could be spaced out by up to 16 weeks, but changed its tune Friday by recommending they should be administered as soon as possible, given the increased supply of vaccines in Canada. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Moving up second doses where possible is a good thing, said Dr. Angie Rasmussen, a virologist affiliated with the Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security. \u201cI agree that some protection is better than no protection. So it makes sense to stretch supplies by delaying the second dose if you have a supply shortage, which Canada has,\u201d she told Global News. But, she added, if there is enough supply, then moving second doses up to a shorter interval is \u201cthe wise thing to do.\u201d Nationwide, nearly 54 per cent of Canadians have received at least a first dose of vaccine, according to the website  , though this varies province by province. Here\u2019s what each province is planning so far for their second doses. On Thursday, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said the province will be moving the interval between first and second doses from up to 16 weeks to eight weeks. \u201cNow that we have a steady supply coming to B.C., the number of people who now have their first dose is high enough that we\u2019re now able to speed up the delivery of second doses,\u201d she said. Henry said the rollout of second doses will prioritize by age and the most vulnerable, beginning with those 70 years old and older. She said the province will begin to send booking invites to those individuals starting Thursday. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The province plans to offer a second dose of vaccine to everyone by the end of August, Henry said. Although Alberta has not yet announced specific plans for moving up second doses in the general population, earlier this month, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the province\u2019s chief medical officer, said that it was likely. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Alberta is still offering first doses to the population, including to kids 12 and up, she said. \u201cOnce we finish offering to all those individuals, we will of course be moving on to second doses so it\u2019s very likely that the interval will be shorter than four months.\u201d Saskatchewan has the clearest timetable among the provinces for its second dose rollout. Groups become eligible based on either their age or the date of their first dose, with people who are older or who got their first dose a long time ago at the front of the line. Week by week, new groups become eligible, descending by age and date of initial vaccine. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t By June 21, people aged 45 and older, or who received their first dose on or before April 15, will be able to get their second dose. By the end of June, eligibility will become dependent solely on the day people received their vaccine. Certain vulnerable populations can also get their second dose sooner. On Wednesday, officials announced that anyone who received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on or before March 29 can book an appointment for their second dose. Premier Brian Pallister on Thursday urged every Manitoban who had one dose to book their second dose as soon as they become eligible, adding he was hoping to book his own second appointment within a few days. Certain high-risk groups are already eligible to book second doses. Ontario will be shortening the interval between first and second doses, the provincial government announced Friday. The change will start with people aged 80 and older, who will be able to book their second dose next week, then will move to those 70 and older the week of June 14. After that, people will become eligible based on when they received their original shot. The province says the shortened interval could be as small as 28 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t days for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines in the coming months, depending on supply. People between the ages of 12 and 25 will become eligible in early August and the province anticipates that most people who want a second dose will have it by the end of the summer. Moving up the second dose is optional and people will keep their original appointments if they don\u2019t re-book for an earlier shot. Currently, Ontarians who received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine between March 10 and March 19 are eligible to book their second shot of AstraZeneca at some pharmacies and primary care facilities. Quebec is moving up the second dose for people over 45 who received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, the province\u2019s health minister announced Thursday. The dose interval will be shortened to eight weeks from the previous 16 weeks. Quebecers can receive their second shot of AstraZeneca at provincial vaccine walk-in clinics starting May 29. If they choose to receive a different vaccine for their booster shot, the interval remains 16 weeks. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The province hasn\u2019t announced details yet on shortening the dose interval for people who received other vaccines, though Health Minister Christian Dube said earlier this week that the government is hoping everyone can be fully vaccinated by Aug. 31. \u201cWith the additional vaccine that we have from Pfizer in June and July, we will be able to accelerate those appointments,\u201d Dube said on Tuesday. Additional details are expected next week. According to the province\u2019s health minister, New Brunswick is currently three weeks ahead of schedule for administering a first dose to residents. \u201cWe planned on being ready at the end of June and finished with first doses, but we\u2019re going to be finished the week of June 7. And so second doses are going to begin immediately after that for those who are in the timeframe that can have them,\u201d health minister Dorothy Shephard said Wednesday. Detailed plans on delivering second doses are being updated and still have to be approved by cabinet over the next few weeks, she said. \u201cThe last thing we want is vaccines sitting in refrigerators. So the vaccine is going to keep coming in and we\u2019re going to make sure it gets into arms.\u201d Nova Scotia announced Tuesday that it will also be speeding up second doses, by around two to four weeks. People who are due soonest for their second dose will be able to move up their appointment in early June and notices for second appointments will roll out over the following weeks in the same order as first-dose appointments. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The province expects it can achieve population immunity, or 85 per cent of the eligible population vaccinated, in early September, rather than the end of October as originally expected. All first doses should be administered by the end of June, and all Islanders should be able to get their second dose by September, said Premier Dennis King on Thursday. \u201cThe second dose appointments have actually already started to be booked for many people in the clinics and they actually have been moved from 16 weeks down to between 12 and 14 weeks after their first doses,\u201d said chief health officer Heather Morrison. Some people are already getting second dose appointments for June, she said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Currently, Newfoundland and Labrador has no plans to shorten the interval between doses of vaccine, according to a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Community Services. Second doses will be administered no later than four months after the first. Yukon has   for both first and second doses across the territory, with second dose administration already underway for residents 18 and over. Second dose appointments are   in the Northwest Territories, including at walk-in clinics. Around 57 per cent of adults in Nunavut have already gotten their second dose of vaccine, and vaccination appointments are ongoing, according to  ."},
{"title": "A look at how Canada approved 5 COVID-19 vaccines in under a year - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted March 28, 2021 6:20 am", "body": "In the last four years,   has approved more than 1,500 new or updated pharmaceuticals. Ten of them are vaccines. Five of those are for  . Dr. Supriya Sharma, the chief medical adviser at Health Canada helping oversee the review process, has never seen anything like the speed with which the COVID-19 vaccines got approved. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cI mean, unprecedented is the one word that we\u2019ve been overusing, but there\u2019s nothing even close to comparable to this,\u201d she said in an interview. The five non-COVID vaccines approved, four for influenza and one for shingles, took an average of 397 days from the day the company applied for approval in Canada, until that approval was granted. The average time for COVID-19 vaccines? 82 days. That includes 61 days for Pfizer-BioNTech, 72 days for Moderna, 95 days for Johnson & Johnson, 148 days for Oxford-AstraZeneca and 34 days for Covishield, the AstraZeneca vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India. Covishield is a slight outlier because Health Canada mostly just needed to review the manufacturing process, as the vaccine is the same formula as the AstraZeneca doses made elsewhere. Sharma likens it to the same recipe made in a different kitchen, but the kitchen still needs to be up to snuff. A sixth vaccine from Novavax is still under review, with the results from its big clinical trial not expected until next month. It has been under review by Health Canada for 58 days at this point. The speed has raised fears among Canadians that everything moved too quickly. Many medical experts worry it is contributing to hesitancy to get the vaccines. But Sharma says speed did not come at the expense of safety. \u201cThat\u2019s the only priority, the only thought, is what\u2019s best for Canadians,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no other motivation anywhere.\u201d Lack of research funds can slow down new drug development, but in this case, as lockdowns shuttered economies worldwide and death tolls mounted, countries poured billions of dollars into getting a vaccine to get us out of the pandemic. Most of the successful vaccines for COVID-19 so far use existing vaccine technology that was adjusted for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t They start with lab studies to check for safety on animals and see how the vaccine works in a lab setting on blood samples and on samples of the virus. Then it is tested on a very small number of humans to look for any glaring safety concerns. Then they test it on a slightly larger number of people \u2014 usually fewer than 100 \u2014 to look for safety and the development of antibodies. If that goes well, the trial is expanded to thousands of volunteers, some of whom get the vaccine and some of whom don\u2019t. Then they wait to see how many in each group get infected. Phase 3 trials usually take between one and four years. For the vaccines approved in Canada so far, phase three trials took about three months. Sharma said the time a trial takes depends on finding enough patients to participate, and then having enough of their trial participants get sick to know how well the vaccine is or isn\u2019t working. Fortunately and unfortunately, COVID-19 was spreading so rampantly in so many places, getting enough people exposed did not take very long. Canada has seen very few vaccines tested here so far, mainly because our infection rates weren\u2019t high enough. While the drug makers were busy getting the trials going, Health Canada was getting ready for their submissions. Sharma said discussions about COVID-19 vaccines began in earnest with international bodies in mid-January 2020, before Canada had even had a single confirmed case. \u201cI think we knew that \u2026 we had a virus that was going to be transmissible, that could be causing significant respiratory disease, and that there would be an interest in therapies and vaccines definitely, very early on,\u201d said Sharma. It was determined quickly that this virus was so new there was no existing vaccine that could be adjusted quickly, as had happened with the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. By March, Health Canada had started putting teams in place to review new therapies and vaccines for COVID-19 as soon as they were ready. Each team was made up of 12 to 15 people, with varying specialties. There was some overlap between the teams but not a lot because many vaccines were being reviewed at the same time. The experts on the file included infectious disease specialists, pharmacologists, biostatisticians, and epidemiologists. Separate from that were teams of people looking at manufacturing facilities. Approving a vaccine isn\u2019t just about making sure the clinical data shows it to be safe and effective, but also about making sure the place it is to be made follows the required safety standards. They needed an emergency order from Health Minister Patty Hajdu to do a rolling review. Normally drug makers can\u2019t apply until they have every piece of data ready but with a rolling review Health Canada scientists can start reviewing the data as it becomes available. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Hajdu granted that on Sept. 16. Then the vaccine submissions began pouring in \u2014 AstraZeneca applied Oct. 1, Pfizer Oct. 9, Moderna on Oct. 12, and J&J on Nov. 30. The Covishield application came Jan. 23 and Novavax submitted on Jan. 29. Sharma says the teams were working 15 to 18 hours a day, seven days a week, reviewing data, asking the companies questions, requesting more information or new analyses. Sometimes they were doing it in the middle of the night. Collaborations with international partners in very different time zones, meant 2 a.m. or 4 a.m. video conference calls were not unusual. When Pfizer and Moderna were reviewed, it was entirely based on clinical trail and pre-market data because the vaccines hadn\u2019t been approved anywhere else. Canada was the third in the world to authorize Pfizer on Dec. 14th, and second to approve Moderna Dec. 23. By the time Health Canada authorized AstraZeneca \u2014 a review process complicated by some mistakes during the clinical trial in dosing and the number of seniors among its volunteer patients \u2014 it was also able to pull data from real-world use of the vaccine in the United Kingdom. The regulatory work doesn\u2019t end when the authorization is announced. The post-market surveillance data is still non-stop. The recent blood clot concern with the AstraZeneca vaccine took a lot of time, but just monitoring the data submitted by the vaccine makers on adverse events overall is still critical. To date, the adverse event reports in Canada have not been different than what was seen in clinical trials. Companies also adjust their submissions requiring further review. Pfizer has so far asked for two changes, one to the number of doses per vial and another for the temperature at which the vaccine has to be kept. If anything changes on safety, or if the efficacy seen in a clinical trial doesn\u2019t play out in the real world, Sharma says Canada will not hesitate to make adjustments. But those decisions will be made by Canadian experts, said Sharma, the same ones who have been on the files all along. \u201cIt\u2019s important that if anything comes up, we have people that have reviewed it, have gone through every piece of paper, the 2,000 hours, the hundreds of thousands of pages, and that if anything comes up, it\u2019s like they\u2019ve got a really strong science base, and they can put that stuff in context and we can make decisions really quickly.\u201d"},

According to the store\u2019s co-owner   prior to Wednesday, the store would sell between 30 to 40 masks per day. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to keep up. The hardest thing now is trying to find inventory or distributors because they\u2019re just hard to get at the moment,\u201d  \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The city said it will be distributing some masks at public facilities for those who don\u2019t have one. The provincial government has distributed 40-million masks across Alberta, with many being distributed at A&W, McDonald\u2019s and Tim Hortons restaurant locations at drive-thrus in the province. However, provincial officials are warning that many of those locations have run out of stock due to high demand in Calgary and Edmonton. According to the province, five-million masks have been distributed to 21 transit services in the province, including Calgary Transit, and 2.5-million masks have been distributed at 1,000 places of worship in Alberta. The province is not committing to providing more masks now that Calgary has introduced its mandatory mask mandate. \u201cNon-medical masks are readily available through commercial suppliers,\u201d Alberta Health spokesperson Tom McMillan said in a statement to Global News. \u201cOur initiative is not intended to take the place of those suppliers on an ongoing basis.\u201d McMillan added that Alberta is the only province in Canada to have distributed free non-medical masks to the public. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Some big-box chains like  are stepping up to ensure customers are wearing masks and will begin to provide masks to customers before they enter the stores. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure that we educate our customers as they come into our buildings,\u201d said Rob Hauta, assistant vice-president of operations at \u201cWe\u2019ll have masks available for customers in the event that they forgot, or maybe aren\u2019t aware of the mask mandate. \u201cAt the end of the day, it comes down to our No. 1 priority, which is keeping our customers and employees safe at all times.\u201d Shopping malls, entertainment facilities and taxis would all be part of the new bylaw. However, spaces such as schools, daycares and private residences would be exempt from the mask mandate. Other exemptions include: \n\t\t\t \n\t\t An infectious disease specialist said that the new bylaw is a good way to lower the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus, despite skepticism from some Calgarians about needing to wear a mask or face covering. \u201cIn the highest-risk indoor environments, we know that masks are likely going to have some type of effect, and that\u2019s where I think they should be used with the highest yield,\u201d Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti said. \u201cSo normalizing the use of masks is going to be important, especially in indoor environments where people are huddled together.\u201d Although the city said it would focus on education over enforcement, non-compliance can net people fines ranging from $100 to $200. On July 27, council made minor tweaks to the bylaw, including adding the word \u201ctemporary\u201d to it. It voted 10-5 in favour of lowering the fine for not wearing a mask from $100 to $50. Council also requested that the mayor send a formal request to the provincial ministers of education and health as well as the chairs of local boards of education, advocating for a mask policy to be created for Calgary students prior to schools reopening. Council wants to direct administration to investigate the potential for schools to be regulated under the temporary COVID-19 face-covering bylaw and report back to council by Aug. 24."},

Centre for Disease control has finally updated its website to acknowledge   is spread by aerosols, not just infected droplets that can only carry a few metres. The World Health Organization recently made a similar change. Aerosols are much smaller particles and can drift in the air like smoke. They disperse quickly outdoors, but not in poorly-ventilated indoor settings. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t It\u2019s a message hundreds of scientists have been sharing for nearly a year \u2014 most recently in an article published in   which argued the virus was \u201cpredominantly\u201d spread by airborne transmission. \u201cIt\u2019s not something new. This is something we thought was true, we behaved as if it was true,\u201d Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre, told Global News. \u201cIt reinforces where the public health guidelines are right now in terms of helping us understand why getting together with people indoors, especially at this stage of the pandemic, is even more dangerous than we might have appreciated.\u201d Until recently, the BC CDC\u2019s \u201chow it spreads\u201d webpage had stated that the virus could both be spread by small droplets that hang in the air and larger droplets, but that \u201cthe majority of COVID-19 infections are spread from one person to another through larger droplets.\u201d Along with directly using the term aerosol, the updated language now that \u201cIndoor accumulation is greater when more people share a space, spend more time together, or exercise, sing, shout, or speak loudly. These conditions can lead to COVID-19 transmission.\u201d Asked about aerosol transmission at her April 22 briefing, prior to the website language change, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry maintained the province had always focused on both small and large droplet transmission. \u201cWe have always said that different size particles can carry virus, but we also know that \u2026 the virus survives more or less well, depending on the size of the particle,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cWe have recognized that smaller particles can transmit this virus, particularly in situations where we\u2019re talking about which are indoors. When you\u2019re in close contact with somebody, where you\u2019re talking loudly, where you\u2019re not wearing a mask, there\u2019s poor ventilation that is unequivocal.\u201d Conway said the move is a recognition of the same science that has led to public health guidelines promoting outdoor activities, and reinforces the need to ensure indoor activities are done in places with good ventilation. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cIndoors we now know its not only the big droplets but the small aerosols that will hang around for a long period of time, especially in areas that are poorly ventilated, and lead to an increased risk of transmission,\u201d he said. Conway said the priority must now be on accelerating vaccinations as much as possible, and deploying more testing to identify virus hotspots.. He said the public also needs to double down on adhering to public health guidelines, particularly those regarding gathering indoors, over the coming weeks. In January, hundreds of doctors, scientists and experts from across Canada penned an open letter to federal chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam, her provincial colleagues, federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu and the nation\u2019s premiers calling for aggressive measures to stop the airborne spread of COVID-19. The letter called for stronger public health messaging to warn of the risks of enclosed spaces, along with stricter inspections and upgrades for ventilation systems in places like schools, long-term care homes and essential institutions."},

{"title": "U.K. changes its vaccine strategy to combat COVID-19 Delta variant. Should Canada follow? - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted June 2, 2021 6:03 pm", "body": " Prime Minister   said there was no reason to delay reopening the economy on Tuesday, as the country races to fully vaccinate all adults in an effort to quell the rapid spread of the Delta   variant. The Delta variant, which is a more transmissible strain of COVID-19 first identified in India, is quickly becoming the more dominant strain in Britain. Officials said the variant accounts for up to three-quarters of newly reported cases as parts of the country undergo a surge in infections, leading to 3,165 confirmed cases on Wednesday. As several provinces begin reopening, some experts say Canada could stand to tweak its vaccination campaign to give high-risk Canadians their second doses faster. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Comparably, the U.K. is slightly ahead of Canada in terms of its vaccine rollout. According to Britain\u2019s Department of Health, 75.2 per cent of adults in the U.K. have received their first shot, and 49.5 per cent are fully vaccinated with two doses. According to  , 58.5 per cent of all Canadians have gotten a first dose, while just 5.6 per cent of Canadians are fully vaccinated. But across the board, there is a consensus: two doses are more effective than one. \u201cWe all have to talk about this being a race between the virus and our ability to vaccinate,\u201d said Ashleigh Tuite, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto\u2019s Dalla Lana School of Public Health. \u201cA fourth wave is absolutely not inevitable, but it\u2019s something that we have to be strategic and be thinking about.\u201d If provincial and federal governments can get second doses into the arms of Canadians quickly, Tuite said it would likely reduce the chance of a detrimental fourth wave triggered by COVID-19 variants. That\u2019s not to say there won\u2019t be a resurgence in cases. \u201cAs long as the virus is circulating globally and as long as we have pockets of people who are unvaccinated, we can expect that there will be cases,\u201d Tuite added. \u201cThe virus isn\u2019t going to go away, but it will be far more manageable if we have people who are vaccinated and who are protected from having severe outcomes and ending up in hospital.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The Delta variant, also known as B.1.617, has already made its way to 10 provinces and one territory. It is  Peel Region\u2019s medical officer of health said he   by next month. \u201cB.1.617 is quickly replacing B.1.1.7. which was the Alpha variant originally detected in the U.K. and which drove our third wave across Brampton and the Region of Peel,\u201d Dr. Lawrence Loh said at a briefing on Wednesday. Sally Otto, an evolutionary biologist and mathematical modeler who is a part of the B.C. COVID modelling group, advised public health officials to keep an eye on hospitalizations and ICU numbers to help them determine whether delaying reopening is in the country\u2019s best interest. \u201cAs long as they\u2019re manageable, we can reopen,\u201d she said of the COVID-19 variants. But \u201cif it is spreading a lot faster and that\u2019s not just in some communities, but spreading a lot faster broadly, then that might mean we have to reverse our reopening plans.\u201d Infectious diseases physician with the University Health Network Dr. Isaac Bogoch said reopening has to be approached carefully. \u201cWe have to protect those who are not vaccinated until everyone has an opportunity,\u201d he said. Those who have been vaccinated are at a lower risk of severe symptoms and hospitalizations, which is why Bogoch said it should come as \u201cno surprise\u201d that the unvaccinated are at the centre of this new wave. Last month,   that a double dose from a COVID-19 vaccine would be at least 60 per cent more protective against the Delta variant and the Alpha strain, which was first identified in Britain. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cSo what do we do?\u201d said Bogoch, in response to the study. \u201cIn Canada, we do exactly what we\u2019re doing.\u201d \u201cWe have mass vaccine efforts in place. We continue to push the first dose fast approach and get as much protection in as greater as a greater number of people as possible,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd then, of course, we have to really focus on second doses and really ensure that we have a smart prioritization of second doses such that we can really protect people who are either more vulnerable to this infection or communities that are disproportionately impacted by this infection.\u201d Dr. Eric Arts, a professor at Western University\u2019s Department of Microbiology and Immunology, echoed Bogoch\u2019s remarks. He said that any vaccinated Canadian who becomes infected with the Delta variant is unlikely to require hospitalization or develop severe symptoms of the virus. However, he said \u201cthat\u2019s still not completely clear.\u201d \u201cThe fact that you could get this variant circulating in those who are immunized puts those who haven\u2019t been immunized at incredible risk,\u201d he said. Vulnerable Canadians who have already weakened immune systems such as seniors could also see more severe symptoms, Arts said, adding it would be wise for the Canadian government to consider making some changes to its vaccine rollout. \u201cIf, for example, we try to finish immunization of the 12- to 18-year-olds before we go back to over-80 year olds for a second immunization, we could be playing with fire,\u201d he said. Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti, an infectious diseases physician at Trillium Health Partners in Mississauga, agreed with Arts. He emphasized that the emergence of vaccines has put Canada in a \u201cvery different situation\u201d than it was in last year. \u201cJust because you see a number of new cases does not mean that a lot of people are going to get hospitalized because that\u2019s exactly what the vaccine does \u2014 it protects against that,\u201d he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t With fewer cases leading to severe outcomes, Chakrabarti said high numbers of COVID-19 cases will eventually become \u201cdecoupled\u201d from hospitalizations and deaths. \u201cFor the entire last year before vaccines, we were accustomed to seeing that when cases went up that meant something bad was going to happen,\u201d he said, explaining that high case numbers meant hospitalizations, overwhelmed hospitals and community lockdowns. As more Canadians become vaccinated and experience milder cases of the virus, Chakrabarti said that will change. \u201cEven if you see cases going up, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that a lockdown is looming or that we have to change anything, because as long as the number of hospitalizations is manageable by wherever you are, then there\u2019s absolutely no need to lock down the community.\u201d But, much like at the beginning of the federal government\u2019s vaccine campaign, Chakrabarti said high-risk Canadians as well as those living or working in COVID-19 hotspots should still be prioritized. \u201cWhat we could do here is make sure now that the hotspots are getting their second dose of vaccine, but understanding that one dose of vaccine is still going to make a huge difference,\u201d he said."},

By summer, as millions more vaccines funnel into the country, there\u2019s a chance for restrictions to lift but there\u2019s a caveat \u2014 75 per cent of those eligible for vaccines need to have one dose, and 20 per cent need a second, according to a  . As of Tuesday, 46 per cent of the Canadian population has received at least one dose of an approved vaccine, according to the  \n\t\t\t \n\t\t With a greater percentage of people vaccinated, especially among the older age groups, the fourth wave when and if it hits, will put less burden on the health-care system compared to the first three, experts say. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed now is with widespread vaccination as well as immunity from people who have been infected previously, the chances of people getting hospitalized are much less,\u201d said Chakrabarti. Bogoch agreed, saying if cases do increase over time, those infected are less likely to land in hospital and have a significant negative impact on society. There is also a lower chance for the unvaccinated younger population to get sick, easing the pressure on hospitals. Starting Tuesday, all adults aged 18 and older in Ontario are eligible to book an appointment for a vaccine. \u00a0vaccine for anyone aged 12 and over, becoming the first country in the world to extend this approval to children.  aged 12 to 17 by the end of the school year next month.\u00a0Meanwhile,   for this age group on May 10 and\u00a0  around the province over the next few months. A summer fourth wave would be \u201cmuch smaller\u201d because of the vaccine rollout and seasonal forcing, Evans said. If many people have first dose vaccinations\u00a0 \u2026 it may not be as catastrophic as previous waves that we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d Sinha added. Canada has seen a 25 per cent decrease in reported active cases since the peak of the third wave in April, according to Theresa Tam, the country\u2019s chief public health officer. Despite the steady progress, public health officials are urging caution amid the spread of more transmissible variants. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t On May 14,  , PHAC designated the B.1.617 variant that was first reported in India as a variant of concern (VOC) after first being listed as a variant of interest. This is in addition to the variants that were first detected in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and  . As of Tuesday, more than   had been reported across all 10 provinces. In the U.K., the sub-lineage  , with scientists warning it was more transmissible than the country\u2019s main strain. \u201cWith variants in play while vaccinations are going up, we have to be very cautious about that downward path,\u201d said Tam during a news conference on Tuesday. \u201cMaintaining our progress to reduce infection rates down to manageable levels, ease pressure on the health system and re-establish public health policy will put us in a better position to prevent a fourth resurgence,\u201d she added. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said things can\u2019t open back up until cases are way down. \u201cOtherwise we risk a fourth wave,\u201d he said Tuesday. Creating safer indoor spaces and vaccinating as quickly as possible will be important to avoid another spike in infections, said Bogoch. Sinha said public health authorities will need to find a balance between making sure that more shots get into people\u2019s arms and reopening \u201cvery slowly and in a responsible way,\u201d \u201cWe still have a long way to go before we can consider ourselves to be out of the woods,\u201d he said."},

Also Tuesday, Alberta identified 1,345 new cases of COVID-19 and five additional deaths from the disease.  Tuesday marked the first day those born in 1981 or earlier could book an appointment to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine. It comes after Alberta announced Sunday it was dropping the eligibility age from 55 to 40, following the advice of public health officials. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u00a0 Health Minister Tyler Shandro and Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw were among those to get their first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine Tuesday. Both took to social media to share pictures of themselves receiving the jab. \u201cAs I have said before, this vaccine is a good choice. In a time when exposure risk is rising sharply, the benefits of protection for anyone in this age group far outweigh the small risk of a rare blood clot,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cWith cases rising, getting immunized is the best way to protect your health and the health of those around you.\u201d I am proud today to be among the Albertans now eligible to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine. By choosing to be immunized, I am protecting myself, my family & my community. AZ remains a smart choice if you are 40+ & not part of phase 2B/C so you can get your vaccine quickly. (1/3)  \u2014 Dr. Deena Hinshaw (@CMOH_Alberta)  Today, along with Dr. Hinshaw, I got my first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine!  As an Albertan over the age of 40, I got my vaccine, not only for myself but for my family, my coworkers and our health system.  If you're eligible, don't wait. Book your shot today. 1/3    \u2014 Tyler Shandro (@shandro)  Premier Jason Kenney, who also falls into the eligible group, said he booked his appointment to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine this Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged to see much more activity at the walk-in sites,\u201d Kenney said during Tuesday\u2019s COVID-19 update. \u201cThis vaccine works\u2026 The risks of adverse effects are miniscule compared to COVID-19. The risks associated with COVID are massively higher.\u201d Alberta Health Services said the 36,000 appointments booked Tuesday include about 8,496 appointments booked in the Edmonton zone and 20,267 in the Calgary zone. \u201cThis is a higher uptake in one morning than over the entirety of last week, when eligibility was limited to Albertans aged 55 and over,\u201d AHS spokesperson Kerry Williamson said. \u201cFor context, 4,525 people received the AstraZeneca vaccine in Edmonton and 5,559 people received AstraZeneca in Calgary between April 12 and April 18.\u201d On Tuesday alone, about 2,726 Albertans received their AstraZeneca immunization at an AHS site. In addition, about 1,500 people took advantage of the walk-in clinics in Edmonton and Calgary. Kenney said that about 107,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered by Monday night and upwards of 70,000 appointments are booked in the next 10 days. \u201cThat\u2019s going up by the minute,\u201d the premier said. \u201cWell done to everybody who is participating.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Kenney encouraged everyone who is eligible to book an appointment as soon as possible. He said the province has about 160,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine remaining and doesn\u2019t know when the next shipment is coming in. \u201cI know that bookings will only gain speed in the coming days.\u201d Eligible Albertans can book an appointment for the AstraZeneca vaccine through the AHS online booking tool or by calling 811. Walk-in immunizations are also available at the Edmonton Expo Centre and Calgary\u2019s Telus Convention Centre but AHS warns walk-in appointments are limited. AHS strongly encourages people to book an appointment. Walk-in clinics for the AstraZeneca vaccine also open April 21 in Lethbridge, Camrose, Red Deer, Grande Prairie and Fort McMurray. On April 23, walk-in clinics will also open in Brooks and Medicine Hat. Eligible Albertans can also book an immunization appointment at a  . More information on who is eligible and how to book a COVID-19 vaccine appointment can be found on the  . \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Alberta has now administered 1,196,428 total doses of COVID-19 vaccine, and 239,277 Albertans have been fully vaccinated with two doses. Kenney said more than 82 per cent of Albertans 75 and older have received one dose of vaccine. About 73 per cent of those 65-75 have received a dose and about 50 per cent of Albertans aged 60-64 have received one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. The premier said Alberta\u2019s first shipment of the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine should arrive by the end of this month or in early May. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t While vaccines offer hope that the end of the pandemic is in sight, Kenney once again stressed we are not out of the woods just yet. \u201cAs much as we\u2019d like to believe that the jab gives us a super power, please remember that it takes a couple of weeks for the vaccine to work its magic. And then we still have to get the second dose when it\u2019s available to get the full protective effect,\u201d he said. \u201cThat first dose is not a licence, by any means, to ignore or go lax on public health guidelines. We still have to, all of us, keep our guard up.\u201d Earlier this year, Alberta announced it would extend the interval between the first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccine to a maximum of 16 weeks, due to a limited supply. Hinshaw reiterated Tuesday that once everyone aged 16 and over in Alberta has been offered a first dose, it will start offering second doses as soon as supply allows. This will likely be in late June, Hinshaw said, based on current supply estimates. \u201cIf you have had a first dose, please do not yet call your pharmacy or AHS to book your second dose. It will take a few more months to get enough supply for both first doses for everyone and to begin second doses,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cAs more doses arrive in the coming months, we will look to shorten this interval whenever possible but that will likely not be until later in the year.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Hinshaw also reiterated that Alberta will use a 12-week interval between first and second doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, depending on the supply. \u201cThe reason for this is that clinical trials for AstraZeneca showed better overall protection when the interval was longer than when it was shorter. Even if we had enough supply to give second doses sooner, the shortest interval that we would use for this vaccine would be 12 weeks.\u201d The extension of timing of all second doses is \u201cbased on current limited supply and evidence showing that this first dose offers significant protection,\u201d according to Hinshaw. The chief medical officer of health said the province is also closely monitoring emerging evidence around the timing of second doses for those receiving cancer treatment and others who are severely immune-compromised. \u201cWe are consulting with provincial and national partners and will update Albertans if any change is made for these groups.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Tuesday\u2019s 1,345 new cases came after 13,163 tests were completed, putting the province\u2019s positivity rate at 10.4 per cent. Alberta identified 816 new variant cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday. Variant cases of concern now make up about 56.9 per cent of all active cases of COVID-19 in the province. Hinshaw said in Alberta, the B.1.1.7. variant, which was first discovered in the U.K., is now the dominant strain. \u201cMeaning transmission is much easier and can happen faster than ever before,\u201d Hinshaw said. She also said Alberta is seeing growth of cases of the P.1 variant, which was first identified in Brazil. Hinshaw said community transmission of this variant is occurring in many parts of the province. Of the 18,481 active cases in Alberta, 8,098 are in the Calgary zone, 4,899 are in the Edmonton zone, 2,543 are in the North zone, 1,900 are in the Central zone, 969 are in the South zone and 72 are not tied to a specific zone. Hospitalizations also continued to increase Tuesday. There are now 476 people in hospital with COVID-19, 105 of whom are being treated in intensive care. Of the five additional deaths reported to Alberta Health over the last 24 hours, four were in the Edmonton zone. A woman in her 100s linked to the outbreak at Allen Gray Continuing Care Centre, a woman in her 60s linked to the outbreak at Rehoboth Christian Ministries, a man in his 60s and a woman in her 70s all died. All of these cases included comorbidities, according to Alberta Health. A man in his 60s from the North zone also died. There are no known comorbidities in this case. Alberta\u2019s death toll from COVID-19 has now reached 2,048. It\u2019s been two weeks since Kenney announced additional public health restrictions aimed at bringing down the rise in COVID-19 cases amid Alberta\u2019s third wave. On April 7, measures took effect that reduced retail capacity to 15 per cent of fire code. Indoor fitness activities were also curtailed, as well as some youth sports and performance activities. On April 9, indoor dining was once again banned in Alberta, although patio dining remained open. \u201cWhile we continue to be very concerned about these high numbers \u2014 1,400 cases a day at this point \u2014 the rate of growth seems to have come down a little bit. \u201cBut it\u2019s too early to take that to the bank.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Kenney said Tuesday that the COVID-19 numbers will be monitored very closely in the coming week, because it would typically take two to three weeks for additional restrictions to make an impact. \u201cWhat we\u2019re watching for right now is the potential increase of cases coming from Easter gatherings that might have happened a little over two weeks ago,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019re watching to see if the additional public health measures have limited spread.\u201d Kenney stressed that \u201cthe timing is so critical right now.\u201d \u201cAll we need to do is look at what\u2019s happening in Ontario. That is real and if we don\u2019t all be careful, that could potentially happen in Alberta.\u201d Late last week, Ontario put out a nation-wide plea amid a surge in new infections and hospitalizations, saying the province was short thousands of nurses and asked whether fellow provinces and territories had resources to spare. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cPlease follow the public health measures so we don\u2019t have to bring in additional restrictions and so that we can let the vaccines get the march on the variants,\u201d Kenney said Tuesday."},

But the website will not be available to the general population in those regions, said a senior government source not authorized to speak publicly about the plan. Instead, public health officials will reach out to a small number of individuals who are 80 or older, as well as some eligible health-care workers, starting Monday. The source said the plan will help the province test components of the system before the full launch, determine whether any changes need to be made to the system and organize the vaccination of larger populations. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The site is a \u201cpublic-facing extension\u201d of the COVaxON system the province has been using since the start of the vaccine rollout, the source said, and will also serve to keep track of inoculation data.

I can do whatever I want,'\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re saying, \u2018No, it\u2019s much more nuanced than that.'\u201d Wondering what you can and can\u2019t do? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the new rules. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t What fully vaccinated Canadians can do outside is fairly clear-cut. Canadians who have received both doses of the vaccine will no longer have to wear masks or physically distance when outside with small groups of people from multiple households \u2014 even if those people are unvaccinated. However, they\u2019ll need to wait 14 days after their second shot to be considered fully protected. This includes hugs, camping with friends, small family barbecues, close contact sports, outdoor weddings and outdoor birthday parties. Indoor gatherings, however, are a bit murkier. Fully vaccinated Canadians can also spend time indoors with other fully vaccinated people. This includes a dinner with a small group of friends, watching sports events, and \u2014 of course \u2014 more hugs. But PHAC is still urging fully vaccinated Canadians to consider wearing a mask, keeping two metres apart and following measures put in place by the event organizer or homeowner when it comes to indoor gatherings from multiple households with people who may be unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. This includes private celebrations or ceremonies, indoor birthday parties, places of worship and the gym. The agency also recommends wearing a mask, following outlined measures put in place and maintaining physical distance for indoor and outdoor gatherings that include large crowds, such as concerts, sporting events and house parties. The news comes after facing days of questions about what those who are double-dosed can do as the country\u2019s vaccine campaign ramps up while hospitalizations and COVID-19 cases decline. As of Friday afternoon,  , while 23.8 per cent of the population was fully vaccinated. The numbers surpassed   of having 75 per cent of Canadians aged 12-years and above vaccinated with at least one dose and 20 per cent fully vaccinated, in order to begin easing restrictions on public movement without overwhelming hospitals and ICUs again. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t PHAC said partially vaccinated or unvaccinated Canadians can enjoy outdoor gatherings with fully vaccinated people, such as a small family barbecue, camping with friends or family, swimming at a lake and share hugs without masks or physical distancing \u2014 \u201cif everyone is comfortable with that.\u201d They are also asked to wear a mask and practice physical distancing at outdoor gatherings, such as a child\u2019s outdoor birthday party or outdoor wedding, with people from multiple households who may be either partially or unvaccinated. When it comes to indoor gatherings such as a dinner with a small group of friends or watching a sporting event, Canadians who have either received one or zero doses are advised to consider flouting public health guidelines only \u201cif everyone is comfortable with that, AND nobody is at risk of more severe disease or outcomes.\u201d Canadians who are unvaccinated or have received one dose can attend indoor gatherings with people from different households who are also either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, such as an indoor party, celebratory ceremony, place of worship or gym. But they must \u201cwear a mask and maintain physical distancing.\u201d \u201cFollow the measures put in place by the owner/organizer to reduce the risk of COVID-19. Keep windows and doors open, if possible,\u201d the guidelines state. Similar rules follow for bigger indoor or outdoor events where large crowds of people are gathering, like a concert, organized sporting event or house party. Those who are not fully vaccinated are asked to \u201cmaintain physical distancing wherever possible\u201d and \u201cconsider only attending events where there are safety plans in place that follow local public health advice.\u201d"},

Ontario reported 1,782 people are hospitalized with COVID-19 (up by 150 from the previous day) with 802 patients in intensive care units (down by 26) and 568 patients in ICUs on a ventilator (up by 21). As of 8 p.m. on Monday, more than 6.3 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered. That marks an increase of 112,103 vaccines in the last day. There are 396,787 people fully vaccinated with two doses. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Officials have listed breakdown data for the new VOCs (variants of concern) detected so far in the province which consist of the B.1.1.7 (first detected in the United Kingdom), B.1.351 (first detected in South Africa), P.1 (first detected in Brazil), as well as mutations that have no determined lineage. The B.1.1.7 VOC is currently the dominating known strain at 95,546 variant cases, which is up by 2,283 since the previous day, 530 B.1.351 variant cases which is up by 19, and 1,592 P.1 variant cases which is up by 34. Here is a breakdown of the total cases in Ontario by gender and age: Here is a breakdown of the total deaths related to COVID-19 by age: According to the Ministry of Long-Term Care, there have been 3,764 deaths reported among residents and patients in long-term care homes across Ontario which increased by two deaths since yesterday. Eleven virus-related deaths in total have been reported among staff. There are 46 current outbreaks in homes, which is up by one from the previous day. The ministry also indicated there are currently 69 active cases among long-term care residents and 161 active cases among staff \u2014 up by two and up by six, respectively, in the last day."},

Called the Ontario COVID-19 Worker Income Protection Program, the provincial government billed the initiative as the \u201cmost generous pandemic paid leave in the country.\u201d The program will be administered by the WSIB and the provincial government will reimburse employers 100 per cent of the employee\u2019s wage for up to $200 a day. Officials also announced the provincial government program could see a $500 top-up to the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB) program conditional on federal approval. Workers who are sick or are experiencing symptoms, who need to get vaccinated or have COVID-19-related mental health issues will qualify for the benefit. However, a spokesperson for Labour Minister Monte McNaughton\u2019s office told Global News freelance and gig economy workers won\u2019t qualify for the provincial program, referring those workers to CRSB. The program, which sources told Global News is expected to cost between $750 million and $1.5 billion, will end on Sept. 25. It\u2019s not clear how soon applications will be processed since the program still needs to be passed by the legislature,  . Officials noted the program will be retroactive to April 19. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The news came after   looking at systemic issues in the province\u2019s long-term care sector. \u201cIf passed, all workers will soon have access to three paid sick days. This is more than the one day available to workers in Prince Edward Island and the two days available to workers in Quebec,\u201d Labour Minister Monte McNaughton told reporters. \u201cThis is a game-changer and this will save lives.\u201d However, questions were raised by critics about the total number of sick days being allocated to workers given if someone is exposed to COVID-19, they can potentially be ordered to self-isolate by public health units for 10 to 14 days. Ontario NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the government\u2019s policy \u201csimply will not cut it.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201c(Workers) will be left making pretty much the same kind of calculation that they\u2019re being forced to make now, which is, \u2018I\u2019ve got the sniffles, I\u2019m not feeling all that great \u2026 but I have to go to work because I don\u2019t have a financial security to stay home,'\u201d she said. Horwath said her party needed to see the government\u2019s legislation before deciding whether to support it but added that it appeared far inferior to an NDP private members bill to introduce 10 paid sick days. Green Party of Ontario Leader Mike Schreiner said he was shocked that after months of pressure, the three-day policy was all that the government has introduced. He called on Ford \u2014 who is self-isolating due to coming into contact with a staff member who tested positive for COVID-19 \u2014 to change the legislation to provide at least 10 paid sick days. \u201cI was hopeful that after the premier took taxpayer-funded paid sick days to isolate after a workplace exposure, he would have had a change of heart,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cBut Ford\u2019s plan falls well short of providing the protection workers need.\u201d Certain other provinces and territories have paid sick leave programs. Prince Edward Island and Yukon both offer employer rebates for up to six (up to three days in two different weeks) and 10 days, respectively. The government was working in recent days to put together a program, but before Wednesday it was unclear when it was going to be unveiled. Global News obtained a letter written by Ontario Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy to Deputy Prime Minister and federal Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland saying the provincial government would provide $500-per-week top-up to the current $500-per-week ($450 after taxes) CRSB. People can access CRSB for up to four weeks if they are required to quarantine because of COVID-19. \u201cIt has become clear that the uptake for the CRSB is not as high as we would like to see, so we must create a greater incentive for people to use the program and stay home when they are ill or experiencing symptoms of COVID-19,\u201d the letter said while going on to reiterate a recent criticism from the provincial government about the 2021 federal budget not addressing issues with CRSB. \u201cWe believe that this (top-up) is the simplest and fastest way to increase program update and make this program more effective for those who are sick, don\u2019t have employer-paid sick leave, and need this program most.\u201d Katherine Cuplinskas, Freeland\u2019s press secretary, said in a statement Tuesday afternoon the CRSB is meant to be a measure for those who \u201cfall through the cracks\u201d because there are no benefits through their employers or in province\u2019s where there isn\u2019t a provincial program. \u201cWhen Ontario is ready to mandate sick leave in provincially-regulated businesses, as we have done for federally-regulated businesses, we will be there to help,\u201d she wrote. It was on Thursday when Ford confirmed his government was working on a plan for an Ontario paid sick leave program. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be one of the best (programs) in conjunction with the federal government in the entire North America. I also want to remind the people of Ontario, there\u2019s no other province in this entire country that has the program that we\u2019re going to be laying out \u2014 nowhere close,\u201d he told reporters when asked about the issue of paid sick days. For months, doctors, health-care workers, and advocates have continually called for a provincial regime for provincial sick days. They pushed for such a program to operate like a wage continuance so workers would be paid as normal if they have to stay home. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t They also cited issues with the requirements under the CRSB, which requires workers to apply to a program and if they qualify under certain criteria, they will be reimbursed at a later time. That delay in receiving money, advocates have said, could impact the timely payment of rent or other bills. On April 20, Ontario\u2019s COVID-19 Science Advisory Table reiterated the need to ensure essential workers continue to receive pay if they need to stay home, are exposed to COVID-19, or need time to get a vaccine. The group said the current federal program is not enough. \u201cAn emergency benefit that offers more money, is easily accessible, immediately paid and that, for the duration of the pandemic, is available to essential workers \u2026 will help limit spread.\u201d The government\u2019s recent messaging on paid sick days has been a noticeable change compared to recent months. When the provincial budget was unveiled in March, questions were raised about why the program was left out. Bethlenfalvy, at the time, pushed people to use the CRSB. Earlier in April, Ford accused people of \u201cplaying politics\u201d with respect to calls for instituting a provincial program. The COVID-19 pandemic was formally declared in early 2020.

Finance Minister Bill Morneau anticipates the wage benefit will cost the government $24 billion. People born in April, May and June can apply Tuesday, those born in July, August or September can apply Wednesday and applications are accepted Thursday from people born in October, November and December. Friday, Saturday and Sunday will be open to anyone. Prime Minister   said Sunday Canadians who sign up for direct deposit could get their first payment before the end of the week. It\u2019s anticipated direct deposit applicants will get money within three to five days, while those who opt for printed cheques will get money in 10 days. \u201cWhile we still have a lot of work to do, we\u2019re making good progress on getting you the support you need as quickly as possible,\u201d Trudeau said. However, opposition parties say there are some glaring holes in the aid that is leaving some people in need out of the program completely. Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre said there are \u201cserious design and delivery flaws\u201d that should be fixed. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Poilievre said some small business owners who paid themselves with dividends don\u2019t qualify because they won\u2019t have $5,000 of employment income in 2019 as the benefit requires. Further, he said a worker who has lost most of their income but still has one contract or a handful of clients won\u2019t qualify for any money because you can\u2019t have any current income in order to be eligible. \u201cThey are effectively banned from doing any amount of work that might help keep their business open,\u201d he said. Poilievre said there are some easy fixes, including adjusting the wage benefit down slightly if a worker earns some income, much like happens when someone is collecting employment insurance but manages to find work temporarily. He also wants small business owners to be viewed as employees for the purposes of the emergency response benefit. NDP MPs Peter Julian and Gord Johns wrote to Morneau Sunday also asking for changes, including to address the fact the benefit provides an incentive not to work at all. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t They said workers who have lost most but not all of their shifts, or lost one part-time job but not the other, \u201care living on significantly reduced incomes\u201d but won\u2019t qualify for the benefit. \u201cThe consequences are that they are now asking to be laid off or furloughed so that they can access the CERB,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis is causing significant disruptions to normal business, to essential services, and to community contributions on local economies.\u201d Opposition parties also want more clarity on the government\u2019s biggest aid program, the $71 billion, emergency wage subsidy, that will cover up to 75 per cent of wages for businesses that choose to keep employees on the payroll rather than laying them off. Poilievre said it is going to take too long for businesses to see any of that money, and some of them won\u2019t survive that long. The Conservatives and NDP both want the government to reconsider the requirement for businesses to show a 30 per cent drop in revenue in order to qualify. To be eligible for the emergency benefit, workers must have earned at least $5,000 in 2019, or in the 12 months before applying. The benefit is the same for everyone regardless of previous income, and is a less complicated application process than for employment insurance."},

The Official Opposition said Tuesday it has obtained internal modelling data from Alberta Health Services that shows the increased strain on hospitals, and particularly intensive care units. The AHS Early Warning System data, which the NDP says it received from healthcare workers, projects upwards of 775 Albertans could be hospitalized with COVID-19 by Dec. 14, with 161 of those people in intensive care. This is on the high end of the projections. The low end of the data projects 76 people will be in the ICU by Dec. 14. As of Monday afternoon, there were 453 Albertans in hospital with COVID-19, 96 of whom were being treated in intensive care. \u201cThe premier went into hiding when he should have been taking action to slow the spread of COVID-19 and ease the massive strain on Alberta hospitals,\u201d Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley said in a news release. \u201cNow, we have frontline physicians warning they will soon face the horrific scenario of triaging patients and deciding who to save. We have hospitals in Calgary with oxygen shortages and we have photos surfacing online of two ICU beds being crammed into a space suitable for one.\u201d An internal memo sent out by AHS last Friday urged staff in Calgary hospitals to reduce the use of bulk oxygen where possible due to expected constraints caused by the pandemic. Dr. David Zygun, Edmonton zone medical director for Alberta Health Services, said the memo was part of an \u201canticipatory\u201d plan to make sure there are ample resources. \u201cWe do have an adequate oxygen supply,\u201d he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The NDP has been calling on the UCP government for weeks to release updated COVID-19 modelling data. \u201cMany other provinces have made this kind of information public. But, repeatedly, the premier told us that modelling didn\u2019t exist,\u201d Notley said. During question period Tuesday, Notley asked the premier why he continues to hide this important information from Albertans. Kenney stressed that the information Notley is referring to is not modelling data. \u201cThe data to which the honourable leaders of the NDP refers is not modelling. I repeat it is not modelling,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether she is saying that out of ignorance or dishonesty. But Mr. Speaker, it is the Early Warning System about which we\u2019ve spoken many times. These are two-week projections that AHS always maintains for surges or any kind of illness, particularly a communicable one of this nature. And Mr. Speaker, the important thing is that AHS is constantly adding additional capacity to meet the growing demand and we will be providing more information on hospital capacity in terms of details in the days to come.\u201d Kenney went on to say that comprehensive data of COVID-19 hospitalizations, fatalities, new cases and recoveries are released every day, \u201cso Albertans have seen this very worrisome increase in cases evident for the past several weeks.\u201d Modelling information previously released by the province showed various scenarios of infection, estimated how many Albertans would require hospitalization or critical care and predicted how many deaths the province could see. However, little information about long-term projections for the province has been provided since the second  . \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Kenney said in early October that Alberta does not have new COVID-19 modelling. \u201cThe department of health, Alberta Health Services, the chief medical officer health and her team are obviously completely focused, every hour of every day, on the challenge of the pandemic, on the trend lines and on our goal of preventing and overwhelming the health-care system,\u201d Kenney said Oct. 9. At the time, he also pointed out the projections released in the spring, thankfully, ended up being way off from the rates Alberta actually recorded. \u201cWe have never achieved a fraction of the number of active cases, of hospitalizations, ICU admissions or COVID-related fatalities that were projected in that modelling,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cAt this point, we don\u2019t believe that creating hypothetical numbers is going to improve our COVID response.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t AHS said Monday that there are currently 173 general adult ICU beds in the province and it has plans to expand that up to a total of 425 ICU beds. In a statement Tuesday, AHS said it is constantly monitoring the current and future demand on the healthcare system, including the growth in COVID-19 cases. It added that the Early Warning System is one tool used to predict hospitalization and ICU numbers. \u201cIt provides a point-in-time forecast, and is updated constantly throughout the day. Yesterday, it forecast a low (76), medium (113) and high (161) number of ICU spaces needed to meet demand. AHS is already increasing capacity to meet this forecast, and the potential for higher demand due to COVID-19,\u201d AHS said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In the coming weeks, about 2,250 acute care beds will also be allocated for patients with COVID-19 across Alberta, AHS said. In the past two weeks, an additional 20 critical care beds have opened in Edmonton and 10 additional critical care spaces opened in Calgary this past weekend, according to AHS. \u201cOur ICU occupancy is very high and we thank our incredible front-line teams for the care they are providing in challenging circumstances,\u201d AHS said. \u201cWe need everyone\u2019s help to reduce demand on our healthcare system.\u201d Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health said Tuesday that she has been concerned about the trajectory and impacts to the healthcare system \u201cfor some time.\u201d \u201cWhich is, of course, why I have been making recommendations to put interventions in place that will bend the curve,\u201d Dr. Deena Hinshaw said. She said the AHS projections \u201csimply take into account the number of cases that we\u2019re actually seeing and the trajectory out, should we continue to see the same kinds of growth trends.\u201d \u201cThat really is based simply on actual numbers within that calculation if nothing were to change looking at that worst-case scenario,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cSo those projections do not take into account the impact of changes and of course, that is exactly the point of those restrictions that were announced last week is to prevent us from hitting those high projections because what we need to do is to bend that curve down.\u201d Dr. Craig Jenne, an infectious disease specialist from the University of Calgary, said the models look fairly accurate, keeping in mind that multiple scenarios are being presented. He said the question that remains is where Alberta sits on the scale. Based on the record rates of infection in the past few days, Jenne believes Alberta is leaning more toward the higher-burden models. \u201cThese high-burden models are showing a near-doubling in ICU occupancy over the next two weeks,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cWe do know, unfortunately, ICU numbers tend to follow case numbers by two to three weeks. So it is the people being infected today that will be the ICU admissions in the next two weeks. So unfortunately, it looks as though those numbers may already be predetermined by the viral load in the community and record numbers that we\u2019ve seen over the past several days. \u201cThe hope though is over the next 10 days the curve begins to flatten and then that will have an impact on hospitalizations and intensive care units. But unfortunately, not for four to five weeks from today \u2014 or the new restrictions \u2014 will we see a dramatic impact on intensive care unit admissions if the restrictions work. And that\u2019s another big if at this particular moment.\u201d New restrictions   were designed to address COVID-19 hot spots while keeping the majority of businesses open. Retails must limit their capacity to 25 per cent and dine-in restaurant seating is now limited to one household per table. Indoor gatherings were also banned across the province. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Jenne said it\u2019s too soon to say if the new restrictions will have a big impact on the COVID-19 curve in Alberta, but suggested they may not go far enough. \u201cSo far from the data we have not seen any hint that the curve had begun to flatten here in Alberta,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, we do know in the next few weeks we will continue to stress the system. There\u2019s nothing that can be done today that\u2019s going to stop new admissions for the next two weeks. The big question is, how well will the restrictions work going forward? It looks as though evidence from other jurisdictions that the restrictions we brought in may not be enough. Again, even with more strict restrictions, curves have not completely flattened and so as a result \u2014 it would be a guess \u2014 but based on the evidence, lighter restrictions are going to be less effective at bringing that curve under control. \u201cSo I\u2019m not overly optimistic that the current level of restrictions will be enough. Hopefully they\u2019ll help. Hopefully they\u2019ll slow things. But I don\u2019t think this will be enough to flatten that curve or to \u2014 at least in the short-term \u2014 ease the healthcare burden.\u201d Hinshaw said Monday she suspects case counts and hospitalizations will continue to increase over the next several days, \u201cas we wait for the impact of the restrictions that were announced last week.\u201d However, she stressed that \u201cat this time, there is adequate capacity to care for all those with COVID.\u201d"},

The new measures, which still need to be approved by Parliament, would create an emergency care benefit for workers who are in quarantine or asked to self-isolate at home due to COVID-19 and don\u2019t get paid sick leave. They also include billions in additional funding for those who are laid off or face reduced work hours because of the virus. \u201cCanadians should not make health decisions based on their financial needs,\u201d Trudeau said Wednesday. \u201cNo matter who you are or what you do, this is a time when you should be focused on your health and that of your neighbours, not whether you\u2019re going to lose your job, not whether you\u2019re going to run out of money for things like groceries and medication.\u201d While the emergency benefits won\u2019t be rolled out until the coming weeks, here\u2019s a look at how they\u2019ll work. Under the new rules, Canadians who have been asked to self-isolate or quarantine can apply for EI without a medical certificate, as would normally be required along with employment records. Workers who can\u2019t apply because they are sick or quarantined, can also file for EI sickness benefits at a later date and have the claim backdated. Anyone looking to apply for the new EI benefits, can visit the   website and follow the five steps.

We are aware of this issue and are working to resolve it.

Generally, EI is based on the number of hours worked in the last 52 weeks and the maximum amount paid out for EI is $573 a week. Under Wednesday\u2019s announcement, EI sickness benefits include being unable to work due to illness or quarantine. The economic aid package includes the emergency care benefit, which would give up to $900 every two weeks for up to 15 weeks to those who don\u2019t qualify for EI but have been sickened by COVID-19, are in quarantine or have to stay at home to care for children or other family members. Canadians can apply for the emergency care benefit by going to the   secure portal, or through a My Service Canada account, or by calling a toll-free number that has not yet been announced. Registration for this benefit is not yet open. Robson said the new federal measures to help workers are not perfect but they\u2019re a \u201cgood start.\u201d Ottawa is also planning to temporarily boost Canada Child Benefit (CCB) payments this year by $300 a child beginning in May. Trudeau also announced a one-time special payment by early May through the goods and services tax credit to more than 12 million lower income families. The average boost to income from this measure is expected to be nearly $400 for single people and almost $600 for couples, according to the government\u2019s projections."},

One of those questions is, if you become infected with   and recover, are you immune to the disease or can you be infected again? Here\u2019s a look at what we know so far. Last week, the   government   that a woman in her 40s, who had been working as a tour bus guide, had been re-infected with the coronavirus, testing positive after having recovered from an earlier infection. The woman, a resident of Osaka in western Japan, first tested positive for the virus in late January but was discharged from the hospital after recovering. She tested positive again on Feb. 26 after developing a sore throat and chest pains, the government said in a statement. The case in Japan and another similar second-positive test reported in China earlier in February have raised concerns about the recovered patient\u2019s immunity to the virus. Stanley Perlman, a coronavirus expert at the University of Iowa told Global News that when it comes to these cases, officials need to determine whether the patients are really re-infected, or if the virus was \u201cnever really cleared\u201d from their bodies. Either way, Perlman says it is a \u201cpuzzling observation.\u201d \u201cI think either of these scenarios is a bit concerning because we would have expected the infected person to have made an immune response so that you couldn\u2019t be reinfected, certainly not two or three weeks later,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, we would have expected the virus to be completely cleared so it couldn\u2019t recrudescence two or three weeks later.\u201d But, Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, told the   it\u2019s unlikely people are being infected for a second time. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that reinfection can\u2019t occur, will never occur, but in that short time it\u2019s unlikely,\u201d he said. Krammer told the paper that even the mildest of infections should leave recovering patients with at least short-term immunity against the virus. He said what is more likely to have happened is that the patients had low levels of the virus in their system when they were discharged by the hospital and that testing had failed to detect it. Similarly, Susan Kline, an infectious disease physician, told   that because the outbreak has only been going on for two months, she would be \u201cvery surprised if people are getting reinfected in that time span.\u201d Kline said she suspects the reported cases are, in fact, a \u201ccontinuation of the original infection.\u201d She said in the case of other coronaviruses that humans become infected with, patients tend to develop immunity after being sick. The body produces antibodies to protect from subsequent exposure, Kline said. She added that it doesn\u2019t last forever and over time the body\u2019s response wanes. Asked how long immunity should last for those who have been infected with COVID-19 but have recovered, Perlman said it\u2019s something we don\u2019t know yet. \u201cWe would hope those people would be protected, but we do not know,\u201d he said. But, Perlman said in a study conducted on another human coronavirus known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), researchers found the antibodies were gone in as little as six months. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t What\u2019s more, Philip Tierno Jr., a professor of microbiology and pathology at New York University\u2019s School of Medicine, told   that he was \u201cnot certain\u201d the virus is not bi-phasic \u2014 meaning it appears to go away before recurring. \u201cOnce you have the infection, it could remain dormant and with minimal symptoms, and then you can get an exacerbation if it finds its way into the lungs,\u201d he said. Bruce Ribner, a professor at the Emory University School of Medicine, told   that when it comes to infectious diseases, there are two types of being \u201ccured.\u201d Ribner told the paper a patient has been \u201cclinically cured\u201d when they feel better and no longer show symptoms. \u201cPathogen cured\u201d refers to when doctors determine the virus is no longer in the patient\u2019s body, and that the individual can no longer transmit the disease, he said. When it comes to COVID-19, Ribner told the Post that \u201cwe don\u2019t yet have a good handle on what it takes\u201d for someone to be pathogen cured. But health officials have been working tirelessly to develop a vaccine to treat the COVID-19, though it is not expected to be released for at least a year. And last month doctors in China began using plasma containing antibodies from recovered coronavirus patients to treat those still battling the infection. The   on Tuesday said the virus, first detected in China\u2019s Hubei province in late December, continues to spread and has now infected more than 90,000 people in more than 70 countries, killing more than 3,100."},

{"title": "Coronavirus: Canadian company announces COVID-19 vaccine candidate  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted March 13, 2020 10:32 am", "body": "A Canadian company says it has made a breakthrough in the  , claiming to have developed a COVID-19 vaccine candidate that could begin human testing as early as this summer. Quebec City-based Medicago said it has produced a virus-like particle of the novel coronavirus, a first step towards producing a vaccine, which will now undergo pre-clinical testing for safety and efficacy. Medicago said it could begin human trials as soon as July or August if approved by Health Canada and other agencies. Company CEO Bruce Clark told Global News that if the vaccine is successful it could be available to the wider public by November 2021. Other media reports erroneously said the vaccine could be ready by November of this year. \u201cThese timelines are heavily reliant on what will give the regulators enough comfort to say this product is ready to go into human testing and then, secondly, for use in the broader public,\u201d he said. \u201cOur best guess right now is 18 months.\u201d Clark said Medicago researchers were able to produce a candidate vaccine within just 20 days of obtaining the gene of the virus. If they are given the green light, they could produce as many as 10 million doses a month out of their plant in North Carolina, according to Clark. The company currently has the resources to create about two million doses a month out of its plant in Quebec. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The biopharmaceutical company said it was able to create a vaccine candidate quickly as it used a plant-based platform, not chicken embryos, to help grow vaccine proteins. Dawn Bowdish, Canada Research Chair in aging and immunity at McMaster University, said the company\u2019s ability to grow virus-like particles in plants has helped it produce vaccines in the past against influenza, including a vaccine candidate against H1N1 in 2009. \u201cA virus-like particle looks like the outside of a virus but doesn\u2019t have any of the genetic material on the inside,\u201d said Bowdish, who also sits on the scientific advisory board of Medicago. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t cause infection but looks really similar from your immune system\u2019s perspective.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Medical researchers around the world have been racing to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, which has sickened more than 127,000 people and killed roughly 5,000. As of Friday morning, there were 159 confirmed cases in Canada, including the prime minister\u2019s wife  . Medicago said it\u2019s also working to develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes COVID-19, in collaboration with the Laval University\u2019s Infectious Disease Research Centre headed by Dr. Gary Kobinger, who helped develop a vaccine and treatment for Ebola. The research is being partly funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR). \u201cThe hope is that we\u2019ll be able to create antibodies that as soon as the virus gets into us, it covers it so it can no longer infect cells,\u201d Bowdish said. Although this was \u201cgood news,\u201d Bowdish cautioned that most vaccine trials fail and in 17 years there was never a vaccine fully developed for the SARS outbreak. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely there will be a miracle drug,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Canada has had some incredible successes creating vaccines very quickly. We had huge success with the Ebola virus.\u201d Globally, there are roughly 20 coronavirus vaccine candidates being developed by research institutes and drugmakers, including America\u2019s Johnson & Johnson and France\u2019s Sanofi SA, according to Reuters. In China, dozens of clinical trials are underway, according to the  , as medical researchers work to evaluate everything from HIV drugs to stem cells and even traditional medicines to treat COVID-19. Two pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. are getting close to human testing. Biotechnology company Moderna Inc. \u2014 working with the U.S.-funded National Institutes of Health (NIH) \u2014 has announced plans to start a trial of a vaccine candidate on 45 people in Seattle this month. Testing on animals will proceed simultaneously with human trials, the NIH told Reuters. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., an immunotherapy company, is working with a company in China to develop a vaccine and expects to start human clinical trials in 30 U.S. volunteers in April. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the U.S. House Oversight and Reform Committee on Thursday that human trials for a vaccine would be possible \u201cwithin a few weeks.\u201d \u201cWe said \u2026 it would take two to three months to have it in the first human,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to do better than that. I hope within a few weeks we may be able to make an announcement to you all that we\u2019ve given the first shot to the first person.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t However, he tempered expectations, stating a vaccine would not be widely available for another 12 to 18 months. The World Health Organization has also made similar projections. \u201cI want to make sure people understand, and I\u2019ve said that over and over again, that does not mean we have a vaccine that we can use,\u201d he said. \u201cWe mean it\u2019s record time to get it tested. It\u2019s going to take a year to a year and a half to really know if it works.\u201d The WHO has said that there\u2019s currently no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19, but that possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are currently under investigation."},

Earlier in March, Global News reached out to individual public health units in all 10 provinces and three territories about their vaccine rollout plans. Some of the questions were:  the provinces and territories responded. Based on these responses, we asked two experts to grade and comment on the performance of each province and territory. Some of the provinces didn\u2019t receive grades due to incomplete answers. Alberta\u2019s health ministry told Global News it has been vaccinating almost 10,000 people on average per day most recently, but have the ability to quickly ramp up to at least 20,000 daily doses if more supply is available. The province is currently in its   and is vaccinating Albertans aged 65 and above, staff and residents of the long-term facilities as well as Indigenous communities. \u201cOverall, I think Alberta, like some other prairie provinces, is really adhering to the NACI (National Advisory Committee on Immunization) guidance and just really making it very clear and efficient how they roll out the vaccine,\u201d said Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Sinai Health and University Health Network hospitals in Toronto. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre, said given the current supply and infrastructure, Albertans could benefit with a short-term goal for its rollout. British Columbia is currently in Phase 2 of its immunization plan. From March to mid-April, approximately 400,000 people will be immunized, including seniors aged 80 and above, Indigenous communities, hospital staff and vulnerable people who live and work in select congregated settings, according to the government\u2019s . Daily vaccination averages have fluctuated because of variations in vaccine supplies, the health ministry told Global News. Dr. Penny Ballem, executive lead for the province\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination efforts, has said she is hopeful that everyone in B.C. who is eligible to receive a vaccine may be offered a first dose of vaccine by July. Besides a few hiccups with the   of the Interior Health\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine phone line earlier this month, B.C.\u2019s rollout has been \u201creally smooth,\u201d said Sinha. \u201cI think B.C\u2019s doing a great job overall. It gets very high marks for taking a look at the NACI guidance and really trying to follow that closely.\u201d Conway gave B.C a C and called its proposed plan \u201ctoo general and vague\u201d. \u201cThe plan needs to be flexible, attending to the needs of more vulnerable inner city populations, using the vaccine to deal with outbreaks.\u201d \u201cWe need to stop using poor vaccine supply as an excuse to not have a positive, forward-approach,\u201d Conway said. Manitoba is aiming to reach its maximum target of administering 20,000 doses per day by April. It is currently at roughly 12,500 doses. According to Dr. Joss Reimer, head of Manitoba\u2019s vaccination task force, the best-case scenario will be May 18 for every adult in Manitoba, who wants to be vaccinated. The worst-case scenario is June 30. Sinha said Manitoba has been rolling out vaccines efficiently and its strategy is pretty straightforward. \u201cOther than the politics and some issues of logistical thoughts and planning, overall the chief medical officer of health has created a very good vaccination strategy that\u2019s clearly communicated, that really prioritizes risk, and I think it\u2019s been generally well received overall \u2013 that people generally understand how their turn is going to come.\u201d he said. Conway gave Manitoba an A- and called its plan \u201cambitious, forward-looking and likely to succeed.\u201d In New Brunswick, vaccine appointments for those aged 85 and older at nearly every pharmacy in the province have opened, with the first vaccinations starting on March 17, according to a  .

Overall, New Brunswick has done a \u201cpretty good job\u201d of managing COVID-19 during the first and second wave,\u201d Sinha said. But it does not have the \u201csame urgency that we see in other provinces like Ontario, Quebec, B.C. and Alberta, to get people vaccinated,\u201d he added. \u201cNew Brunswick is a province where we\u2019re not getting a huge amount of information in terms of how they\u2019re approaching the vaccinations of their population.\u201d Newfoundland & Labrador is currently in its  , focusing on congregate living settings for seniors, health-care workers, adults 85 years of age and older and adults in remote and isolated Indigenous communities. The province did not disclose an average number of individuals it was planning to vaccinate, saying it was contingent on vaccine supply. Sinha called N.L. a \u201cmystery island\u201d because of a lack of transparency about their vaccine rollout plans and targets. He said they are getting the same per capita vaccine as every other province, but it\u2019s difficult to rate their performance. \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t see why Newfoundland cannot achieve the same kind of goals that other provinces are,\u201d he added. Conway said: \u201cThere is great caution and lack of commitment in the responses, which is at odds with a program that has vaccinated seven per cent of its population to date.\u201d All eligible residents above the age of 18 in 33 communities across the Northwest Territories have been offered the coronavirus vaccine. The territory has a population of roughly 45,000 people. \u201cThere\u2019s been a really good rollout and uptake that\u2019s been quite efficient, especially when you think about the logistical issues of getting vaccines out to really remote communities,\u201d said Sinha. He said all three territories are \u201cwell ahead\u201d in the vaccine distribution compared to the rest of Canada. However, Conway said the NWT\u2019s plan would be more reassuring if more details were given. He gave the territory a B. Nova Scotia is aiming to give all eligible and willing residents their first doses by the end of . The Nova Scotia Health Authority told Global News it was on track to immunize 75 per cent of Nova Scotians by the end of September. Sinha said Nova Scotia is not administering vaccines as rapidly as other provinces. \u201cThey certainly aren\u2019t, in my view, approaching their vaccination strategy with maybe the same zeal as other jurisdictions,\u201d he said. With only  \u00a0as of Mar. 19, Sinha also noted that the province \u201cdon\u2019t have the same pressure that other jurisdictions have at the moment.\u201d Conway gave the worst grade to Nova Scotia: D. He said although the province ranks low in terms of people vaccinated, he anticipates it will do better than the 75 per cent target for the end of September. Nunavut has received its full allotment \u2013 37,500 doses \u2013 of the Moderna vaccine from the federal government to vaccinate 75 per cent of adults aged 18 and above in the territory. Nunavut\u2019s department of health told Global News that by the end of April, all communities would have completed mass vaccination clinics for the first and second dose. Among the northern territories, Sinha says Nunavut has been like a \u201cblack box.\u201d \u201cYou know they\u2019re doing some good stuff, but you just don\u2019t quite have a handle,\u201d he said. For a territory that does not have very well-developed infrastructure and resources, Nunavut is doing a \u201cvery commendable job in getting this vaccine out to communities to give people in the north a real shot of hope,\u201d Sinha said. Conway gave Nunavut an A for its \u201crobust approach to ensure that both vaccine doses are received in a way that is consistent with optimal clinical practice.\u201d The largest province of Ontario is still in its  of the rollout plan. The government says its COVID-19 vaccination rollout is   and will therefore begin the inoculation of residents aged 75 and over beginning Monday. A pilot program offering vaccines in some pharmacies is also expanding, and will now offer the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot to anyone aged 60 and older. Most public health units are confident they will be able to meet the federal government\u2019s September target, but say that will be dependent on vaccine supply. Ontario has struggled with its vaccine rollout, according to Sinha. \u201cOntario\u2019s really had a very scattered approach, and it\u2019s an approach that\u2019s been marred by a changing overall strategy at the central level, but then also trying to deploy things at the level of 34 different public health units.\u201d He said the distribution of doses has not been equal and the province\u2019s infrastructure will be put to the test in the coming weeks and months when an influx of millions of vaccine doses is expected. Conway gave Ontario a B grade. \u201cA strong regional and provincial effort to reassure us, for the most part, that this will be done by the fall. When vaccine supply appears, there is a clear plan to use it,\u201d he said. Prince Edward Island is currently vaccinating individuals living in congregate settings, such as shelters and group homes, adults in Indigenous communities, rotational workers, truck drivers, health-care workers, those aged 80 years and older and one partner in care. Starting Monday, individuals ages 70 to 74 can begin booking their vaccination appointments, according to a  . \n\t\t\t \n\t\t According to Heather Morrison, P.E.I.\u2019s chief public health officer, the province is on track to meet the target of immunizing over 80 per cent of the eligible population over the age of 16 with at least one dose of the vaccine, by the end of June. Sinha gave top marks to P.E.I., and said it has \u201cone of the best vaccination rollouts\u201d of the Atlantic provinces. \u201cThey\u2019ve been using a very clear age, first priority sequence and really just rolling on getting that vaccine out of fridges and into people\u2019s arms.\u201d But Conway is not impressed. He called the province\u2019s rollout plan \u201ccautious.\u201d Quebec\u2019s Ministry of Health and Social Services told Global News at the time the province is currently receiving approximately 100,000 doses per week and is vaccinating roughly 13,360 people on average per day. As of this week, the province is vaccinating about 31,701 people per day. It is in the process of expanding that capacity to administer approximately 500,000 doses per week. Quebec\u2019s goal was to vaccinate at least 75 per cent of the target audience for COVID-19 vaccination by the end of 2021. The province   it plans to give a first dose to every adult who wants one no later than June 24. \u201cQuebec has been quite smart with its approach,\u201d said Sinha. \u201cThey\u2019ve been following the science and really focusing on protecting as many people as possible. I think they\u2019re actually going to reach their targets quicker than others.\u201d Conway gave Quebec a C. He said the province was \u201cway too fearful of inadequate vaccine supply\u201d. Saskatchewan has entered  , which is focusing on vaccinating the general population from people aged 69 going down to 18. While the province has not confirmed if they will be able to meet the federal government\u2019s target, Saskatchewan Health Authority CEO Scott Livingstone said people won\u2019t have to wait up to four months to get their second dose if there\u2019s increasing supply.\u201d Provincial officials are optimistic about the number of vaccines scheduled to arrive in the future. Saskatchewan has been following the NACI guidance, said Sinha. They\u2019ve already started vaccinating people 70 and older and they\u2019re just moving on, getting the vaccine rolled out and doing it efficiently.\u201d Conway said the province\u2019s plan is incomplete for failing to detail how they plan to build on what it has accomplished so far. In Yukon, the vaccine campaign is based on appointments. The territory\u2019s capacity is to vaccinate between 850 and 1,000 people per day and it has hit its maximum capacity for several days, the Health Social Services department told Global News. The government anticipates having everyone who wants a vaccine to be vaccinated by the end of March or mid-April. Like the Northwest Territories, Sinha is impressed with Yukon\u2019s rollout and its communication about the progress. Conway agreed and gave Yukon an A. \u201cThe plan is specific, forward-looking, flexible and will lead to community-based immunity in the short term,\u201d he said."},

The industry group had been working with Alberta Health Services on a rollout plan which was accelerated when the region\u2019s case rates started to spike. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThe first ones have already taken place,\u201d OSCA executive director Perry Berkenpas told Global News on Thursday. \u201cCNRL Horizon had a clinic this last weekend and coming up, you\u2019ll see that walked across a number of other sites as long as there\u2019s supply available.\u201d A CNRL spokesperson said the company worked with AHS for a \u201csite-specific clinic\u201d from May 2-4, during which \u201cmore than 1,600 employees and contractors voluntarily took the opportunity to be vaccinated.\u201d That doesn\u2019t include workers who are booking vaccinations at other clinics or through pharmacies. AHS, in partnership with industry, has started to offer onsite immunization clinics at camps and sites in the RMWB to anyone 18 years or older. Bookings are managed by each site and company, the province said. Workers can also access the other vaccine options off-site province-wide. Anyone 18 and older in the RMWB can book an appointment immediately through AHS or 811. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In a statement, Suncor said it\u2019s determining the best way to distribute the additional vaccines to workers and the broader community. \u201cPlans for Suncor-specific vaccination clinics have not yet been finalized. \u201cSuncor will not be making vaccinations mandatory for our workforce, although in Alberta, rapid antigen screening will be mandatory for site access to our Firebag, Fort Hills and MacKay River sites, for all contractors supporting planned maintenance events in the region, at our Edmonton refinery, as well as for any fly in/fly out Suncor workers.\u201d The Fort McMurray region has one of the highest rates of active COVID-19 cases per capita in all of North America. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the variants have changed things for us,\u201d Berkenpas said. \u201cUp until the last few weeks, we have seen that the case rate total for oil sands workers has been lower than, on average, from the Alberta community or even the North Health Region, but it\u2019s certainly changed recently.\u201d He said about 64 per cent of the active cases connected to oil sands sites involve variants of concern. On Thursday, Canadian Natural confirmed two contractors, employed by service providers conducting maintenance activities at Horizon, died of \u201ccomplications from COVID-19,\u201d a spokesperson told Global News. \u201cCanadian Natural extends our deepest sympathies to the family, friends and colleagues of these individuals.\u201d According to Alberta Health, the CNRL Horizon site has had a total of 1,093 COVID-19 cases \u2014 482 are currently active, 609 are listed as recovered and two deaths were reported. The RMWB declared a local state of emergency and Premier Jason Kenney recently announced an expedited vaccine rollout to the area, as well as another hard-hit area: Banff. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t On Tuesday evening, the premier announced new public health restrictions, some targeting areas with particularly high COVID-19 cases (more than 50 cases per 100,000 people and with 30 or more active cases). The new rules closed patios, moved all school grades online and, effective May 5, any workplace with transmission of three or more cases will be required by health officials to close for 10 days. However, work camps and essential and critical services are exempt. \u201cWhile they\u2019re essential, not everyone is critical,\u201d Berkenpas said. \u201cSo up to 60 per cent of the folks that are normally working from those sites have not been working from those various projects.\u201d  since the start of the pandemic, Berkenpas said, and have increased safety measures, including reducing the number of people on shift, making schedules for the lunch room, closing gym facilities and common areas, reducing the number of people on transport like buses and planes and increasing rapid testing. \u201cSome locations have had up to daily tests for folks,\u201d he said. But labour unions say it\u2019s not enough and the outbreaks are creating an unsafe work environment. \u201cSome people were actually leaving before the end of their shifts because they were fearful of the virus,\u201d said Gil McGowan, president of the Alberta Federation of Labour. \u201cWhen I see these numbers, they are eye opening and they are shocking. It\u2019s a red flag. \u201cIt\u2019s not limited to that one particular site. There are more than a dozen oil sands related construction sites that have more than 100 active cases.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t McGowan says he doesn\u2019t point the finger at oil companies, who, for the most part, are following and enforcing the public health measures. He thinks the province needs to bring in stronger safety guards for sites like these. \u201cThe problem was that the provincial government had set the standards too low,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we think of these oil sands work camps, they\u2019re basically hotels in the middle of nowhere and near these oil sands development sites. People are living in very close quarters and it\u2019s not a surprise that, given the aerosol nature of COVID-19 spread, that these have become hot beds for transmission. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying the public health guidance has not been keeping up with the science for a very long time. What we need is better masking rules that are actually enforced, we need rules on proper ventilation,\u201d McGowan said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Alberta\u2019s oil sands continue to fly in workers from across Canada. There are currently outbreaks at more than a dozen oil and gas work sites and hundreds of workers infected, according to Alberta Health\u2019s numbers. \u201cThe situation is out of control,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cWe\u2019re happy for the work but it has to be in a safe work environment. \u201cCOVID, especially these new variants, is being spread very aggressively in workplaces, especially in oil sands work places,\u201d he added. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThis is a workplace hazard. It needs to be mitigated. If it can\u2019t be mitigated, the work places have to get shut down until the transmission gets close to zero.\u201d Alberta Health said it issued guidance on industrial work camps \u201cthat implemented proven processes and best practices to help protect the health of all involved\u201d and is not aware \u201cof any widespread cases of this guidance not being followed.\u201d Infectious disease specialist Dr. Craig Jenne says in order for vaccinations to help oil camps get out of outbreak crises, two things must happen. \u201cOne is ensuring that everybody gets the shot. We have to remember that even in these camp environments, it\u2019s still a voluntary procedure. So we do not force treatment on anybody. We need to make sure we have high enough vaccine uptake. \u201cThe other critical piece to remember is protection is not instantaneous. \u201cSo, if we\u2019re seeing mass vaccine campaigns, for example, this week, it\u2019s going to be at least another two weeks before we see that optimal immunity and the ability to slow the viral spread. \u201cSo (between) now and then, we can expect the virus to continue to spread through these populations.\u201d Jenne, an associate professor in the department of Microbiology, Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the University of Calgary, said other precautions \u2014 like masks and physical distancing \u2014 are hard to maintain in settings like work camps. \u201cPeople are living together, flying in, eating in communal dining halls\u2026 These are all activities that drive viral spread.\u201d But, he said, another factor is just how much virus is circulating in the broader Alberta community. \u201cWith the amount of virus\u2026 it\u2019s not at all surprising it\u2019s spreading in these work environments,\u201d Jenne said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cIt\u2019s partly the variants \u2014 they definitely can spread more easily and lead to larger outbreaks \u2014 but it\u2019s also simply the fact that we\u2019re dealing with more virus in the province than we ever have before so it becomes increasingly (hard) \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to keep virus out of the camps.\u201d \u00b7 Cenovus Sunrise Lodge, Fort Mckay: 14 cases (4 active, 10 recovered) \u00b7 Civeo Lynx Lodge, Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo: 77 cases (18 active, 59 recovered) \u00b7 CNOOC Long Lake, Anzac: 17 cases (7 active, 10 recovered) \u00b7 CNRL Albian, Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo: 223 cases (35 active, 188 recovered) \u00b7 CNRL Horizon, Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo: 1,093 cases (482 active, 609 recovered, 2 deaths) \u00b7 CNRL Jackfish, Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo: 26 cases (2 active, 24 recovered) \u00b7 Kearl Lake work site, Fort Mckay: 101 cases (32 active, 69 recovered) \u00b7 Oilsands Industrial Lodge, Fort Mackay: 11 cases (2 active, 9 recovered) \u00b7 Suncor base plant, Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo: 639 cases (148 active, 490 recovered, 1 death) \u00b7 Suncor Firebag, Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo: 21 cases (8 active, 13 recovered) \u00b7 Suncor Fort Hills, Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo: 40 cases (9 active, 31 recovered) \u00b7 Suncor Mackay River, Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo: 15 cases (2 active, 13 recovered) \u00b7 Syncrude Aurora, Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo: 70 cases (36 active, 34 recovered) \u00b7 Syncrude Mildred Lake site, Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo: 854 cases (369 active, 485 recovered) \u00a0"},

Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister announced the new orders, which go into effect Saturday, along with chief public health officer, Dr. Brent Roussin Thursday. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The announcement means a ban on social gatherings, both indoors and out, that was due to expire Saturday will now remain in effect for another two weeks. The same goes for a rule that requires only one person per household to enter a store or other business.

But after hearing reports of people meeting up at malls for social purposes, the province is giving marching orders to security staff. \u201cThese malls are directed to evict people who are gathering with others,\u201d Roussin said. The news comes as the province continues to see swelling hospital rates connected to COVID-19 and health officials reported 297 new cases and eight additional deaths Thursday. To protect ICU capacity, the province started transporting critically ill COVID-19 patients to Ontario last week in order to keep critical care beds open. At least 26 patients have been sent to Ontario since May 18. Saskatchewan was to start accepting a small number starting Thursday. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Public health orders tightened for the May long weekend that had been set to expire Wednesday were extended to Saturday earlier this week.

Those temporary orders come on top of a ban on indoor public gatherings and a 10-per cent limit on capacity at stores that have been in place for three weeks. Restaurants have been restricted to takeout and delivery, while gyms and hair salons have had to close. Earlier this week half a dozen doctors called on the Progressive Conservative government to close non-essential businesses and enact a stay-at-home order. The surge of   patients and the need to reassign health-care workers have resulted in cancelled surgeries and backlogs in other areas of medical care, they said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Provincial data Thursday showed there are now 324 people in hospital as a result of novel coronavirus, up six from the day before, and 73 patients in ICU connected to the virus. The province\u2019s ICU numbers don\u2019t include patients who have been transferred out of Manitoba for care. There are currently 4,639 active COVID-19 cases in Manitoba, according to provincial numbers, and the current five-day COVID-19 test positivity rate is 12.6\u00a0 per cent provincially and 14 per cent in Winnipeg. Pallister urged people to get vaccinated and follow the public health orders. He also defended his government\u2019s decision to not order a full shutdown of non-essential businesses at the start of the third wave. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThere\u2019s another factor: that\u2019s the willingness of people to follow the rules. That\u2019s a key determinant in the model that public health uses to ascertain what is effective and what is not,\u201d the premier said. \u201cHow do you imagine the public would have been affected by introducing public health rules \u2014 when we had fewer than a hundred cases \u2014 that restricted all non-essential retail? Do you think we would have got buy-in from the public?\u201d \u2014  can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing \u2014 very similar to a cold or flu.

The province has opted for a three-step process. Eligible British Columbians must first register and receive a confirmation code. Once they get an email, text or phone call telling them they are eligible to book, they can then book an appointment. The final step is visiting a vaccination clinic and getting vaccinated.

Once again, Jason Kenney does not have the guts to eject MLAs from his government caucus despite their reckless and dangerous behaviour during a public health emergency.\u201d Alberta has now administered 1,597,666 doses of COVID-19 vaccine. On Saturday, the province announced a change with how parents and guardians of eligible children can book   vaccine appointments. Last week, the province announced children born between 2006 and 2009 with underlying health conditions were eligible for a Pfizer vaccine. On Saturday morning, Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw tweeted that a note from a doctor would no longer be required for eligible children to book an appointment, which was previously the case. Hinshaw said the change was made based on feedback from parents, family doctors and pediatricians. Parents and guardians can make a decision to have their child get the vaccine if they\u2019re eligible. If parents/ guardians have questions, they can talk to their doctor, but they don\u2019t need to get a letter before getting immunized. (4/6) \u2014 Dr. Deena Hinshaw (@CMOH_Alberta)  On April 23, the province approved the Pfizer vaccine for children 12-15 years old with health conditions that put them at great risk for severe outcomes if they were to be infected with COVID-19. Alberta is among the first jurisdictions in the world to make this decision. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization has recommended approving Pfizer for teens but Health Canada has yet to do so. \u201cNational Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has stated that youths aged 12-15 with a pre-existing health condition are more at risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19 than from a COVID-19 vaccine, and would benefit from getting Pfizer vaccine,\u201d Tom McMillan, a spokesperson for Alberta Health, told Global News in an email. \u201cPfizer has submitted safety and efficacy data for this age group to Health Canada with an application to expand the age of licensure.\u201d Children born between 2006 and 2009 who are eligible for the Pfizer vaccine include those who have cancer, chronic heart disease and chronic kidney disease. Doctors have been reacting to Alberta Health Service\u2019s triage plan made public Friday. According to the critical care triage document put together by Alberta Health Services to manage an overrun of intensive care patients amid the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic, health-care workers are to prioritize incoming patients who have the greatest chance of survival. In Phase 1, health-care workers would use a series of tools to estimate whether someone\u2019s likelihood of death in the ICU and one year after would be 80 per cent or over. If it is, they would be refused admission to the ICU at that time. In Phase 2, the threshold is over 50 per cent likelihood of death. Pediatric triage will only be considered in Phase 2, the guidelines say. An Edmonton doctor said the fact the document is now public makes it clear the province is in a grim situation. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019re here is really a testament, I would say to two things: one is our policy. Our COVID-related policy has been consistently reactive and has also been very weak in terms of implementing measures, so strong measures have not been implemented,\u201d University of Alberta assistant professor Dr. Tehseen Ladha said. \u201cThe other factor is really more philosophical. In some ways, what we\u2019ve done, always done in this province is looking at how we can mitigate COVID or bend the curve rather than eliminate COVID, which other provinces, again, like the Atlantic provinces and other countries have done with much success.\u201d Ladha said she has been told the document has been in preparation for years but has never been finalized, has never been presented to doctors and medical staff have not been trained to use the protocols. She believes if further restrictions are not implemented by the province, physicians will have to use the protocols outlined in the document."},

The three provinces have explicitly listed severe obesity as among the criteria for vaccine eligibility once their respective programs expand. Some other provinces appear to be considering it or including it in combination with other criteria, but many tell Global News obesity will not be among the conditions allowing for next phase eligibility. The Public Health Agency of Canada lists people with severe obesity, or a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher, as among those   from COVID-19. Around the world, numerous studies have shown that people with obesity face a greater risk of severe illness from COVID-19, with   suggesting that individuals with obesity face a 113 per cent increased risk of hospitalization and 48 per cent increase in death. \u201cThat is because when you are carrying excess weight, your immune function is impaired,\u201d explained Alberta-based obesity expert Dr. Renuca Modi. \u201cYou\u2019re in a chronic inflammatory state. You\u2019re more prone to blood clots and then your lung capacity reserve is poor, it\u2019s less. And that can make ventilation so much more difficult.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The Alberta Research Centre for Health Evidence has been studying a variety of factors associated with increased risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19, including obesity. A   \u2014 and   from the National Advisory Committee for Immunization (NACI) \u2014 found that class III obesity, which involves a BMI of 40 or higher, is associated with at least a twofold increase in hospitalization when compared to people with a BMI of 25 or lower. \u201cWe did find for less severe classifications of obesity, BMI 30-39, that there were small associations with hospitalizations, but little to no association with mortality,\u201d Lisa Hartling, one of the report\u2019s authors told Global News. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Jennifer Pillay, another author of the report, added that they reviewed 34 large, high-quality studies that accounted for comorbidities, or additional conditions, to give a more accurate reflection of the impact of a single condition. \u201cThe studies that don\u2019t account for those things tend to show quite a bit higher associations. So I think some of the literature coming out with obesity probably hasn\u2019t been adjusted for some of those other comorbidities,\u201d she explained. The authors add that data for obesity is still undergoing final analysis. An updated review is expected next month. Modi says obesity is associated with numerous other conditions like diabetes, heart disease, a number of cancers, and respiratory issues. Anecdotally, she says she\u2019s seen just how severely the virus has impacted patients at the Edmonton Bariatric Subspecialty Clinic. \u201cThis is not my first day in clinic where I picked up my list and call the patient, and then I get on to Connect Care because they\u2019re not picking up, and I see that they\u2019re admitted (to hospital with COVID-19),\u201d she said Wednesday. \u201cThis is why I\u2019m so passionate about it. This is why I\u2019m celebrating the fact that it\u2019s on that list. We are seeing it day in and day out in our clinic: our patients are being admitted.\u201d According to  , more than one in four Canadian adults reported height and weight that classified them as obese (BMI of 30 or more). The proportion of adults with obesity was lower than the national average of 26.8 per cent in Quebec and British Columbia and higher in all other provinces, particularly along the east coast. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The Public Health Agency of Canada says obesity \u201c  that involves a wide and interactive range of biological, behavioural and societal factors.\u201d In addition to diet and exercise, obesity is also influenced by \u201c .\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a lifestyle choice, it\u2019s not a choice that people make,\u201d Modi says. \u201cObesity medicine has exploded in the last 10 years. We know so much more. This is a chronic disease. And one of the biggest obstacles right now in the communities and everywhere else where we\u2019re trying to engage people in weight management is weight stigma and bias.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Adrianna McDonald, a 37-year-old from Alberta, has firsthand experience facing stigma and bias. \u201cUnfortunately, fat-shaming is one of those things where it\u2019s still pretty socially acceptable and that\u2019s really sad because there\u2019s so many different factors in somebody\u2019s weight,\u201d she explained. \u201cPeople look at me and automatically assume, \u2018well, she\u2019s lazy and she does nothing.\u2019 Or some people, I should clarify. I\u2019m down 80 pounds from my highest and I\u2019ve maintained that for quite a few years now but I still am considered somebody with obesity.\u201d She says she\u2019ll be getting her vaccine as soon as she\u2019s eligible in order to protect herself and her loved ones. While Manitoba, Ontario, and Alberta are including people with a BMI of 40 or higher as among those being prioritized in their next phase of vaccinations, their approaches differ slightly. In Alberta, people age 16 to 64 with certain high-risk underlying health conditions \u2014 including those with a BMI of 40 or higher \u2014 will be eligible for vaccinations under the province\u2019s Phase 2B rollout which begins in April. Manitobans age 50 to 64, and First Nations people age 30 to 64 in Manitoba, with a high-risk condition \u2014 including severe obesity \u2014 will be among the first groups eligible to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine.   anyone who is already eligible for the Pfizer/Moderna vaccine age 18 to 64 is also eligible for the AstraZeneca one. In Ontario, individuals with specified health conditions will be vaccinated in order of risk with the highest-risk group first, followed by high-risk, and then at-risk individuals. Obesity is listed in the high-risk category. No doctor\u2019s note or referral will be required in any of these provinces. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Elsewhere in Canada, obesity is not among the list of conditions identified for vaccine prioritization in British Columbia, but its ministry of health tells Global News that its plan is mostly based on age and as a result, \u201cit simultaneously takes into account many diseases and health conditions that are increasingly more frequent with advancing age.\u201d Saskatchewan says obesity is not a condition prioritized for vaccination in  . Quebec says as more vaccines become available, eligibility will be expanded. In  , adults under 60 \u201cwho have a chronic disease or health problem that increases the risk of complications of COVID-19\u201d are listed as the eighth priority. Quebec tells Global News that the list is still being finalized, but obesity with a BMI of 40 or more  . \n\t\t\t \n\t\t New Brunswick appears to be focusing on comorbidity, with individuals age 40-59 \u201cwith three or more select chronic conditions\u201d (including obesity with a BMI of 40 or more) eligible \u201cfor vaccination around the month of May.\u201d Proof will not be required. Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and PEI are not including obesity among their lists of conditions prioritized for their next phases of vaccination. In Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut, obesity is not being prioritized but vaccination efforts have either already expanded to, or are about to expand to, the general population."},

Alberta opened up bookings on March 10. So, on June 2 \u2014 next Wednesday \u2014 it will be 12 weeks since some Albertans received their first shot. John Chwyl got the first appointment he could find. \u201cIt was something I needed to do to keep myself healthy, well and alive. \u201cSo I very willingly got the first vaccination,\u201d he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Since then, controversy has swirled around the AstraZeneca vaccine, specifically concerns around rare blood clots, changing guidelines around its usage, and supply concerns. Chwyl said it all left him feeling anxious about his second dose. \u201cI want to be fully vaccinated because as I understand, when I\u2019m fully vaccinated, I\u2019m at my most protected,\u201d he said. Then there was talk about potentially mixing and matching second doses, but late last week, the   said there wasn\u2019t enough science to support that, and  . \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Knowing he was fast approaching 12 weeks since his first dose, Chwyl called to try and book his second, but was told he couldn\u2019t and needed to wait. He\u2019s not alone. Another Edmontonian, who asked to remain anonymous, sent Global News a voicemail he received from HealthLink, after calling to inquire about his second dose of AstraZeneca. It said: \u201cYou\u2019re looking for your second dose of AstraZeneca, we apparently have some appointments in the Edmonton region, if you could give us a call back at 811.\u201d But when the man called to make the booking, he says he was told the policy changed and he too would have to wait. A screengrab of   also shows that at one point last week, it was directing people to call 811 to book second doses but that has since been removed. For Chwyl, the messaging is confusing. \u201cI get that it\u2019s an ever-changing process, it\u2019s brand new for all of us. But what I can\u2019t understand is the inconsistency from day to day to day. We\u2019re here, then we\u2019re here, then we\u2019re back there. It\u2019s mind boggling.\u201d But an infectious disease researcher from the University of Calgary, Dr. Craig Jenne, said people don\u2019t need to worry yet. \u201cThe clinical studies from AstraZeneca, which was a little different than the two mRNA vaccines, actually demonstrated better protection if you waited at least 12 weeks for that booster.\u201d Jenne said second doses are important, as they boost immune memory and provide better protection against the variants, but he thinks appointments will come soon. \u201cI would anticipate those people that are coming up to three months right now will start to receive their notifications for the booster shot.\u201d Alberta Health currently has 7,300 doses of AstraZeneca and they don\u2019t expire until the end of June, said spokesperson Tom McMillan. \u201cAlbertans are eligible for their second dose of AstraZeneca no later than four months and no earlier than three months after the first dose,\u201d he explained. However, 7,300 shots won\u2019t be enough. Global News asked on two separate occasions whether Alberta has asked for more AstraZeneca and when it\u2019s coming \u2014 and if not, why not. Those inquiries went unanswered. When Premier Jason Kenney announced Alberta\u2019s re-opening plan, it added to Chwyl\u2019s anxiety. \u201cGet the second vaccination as quickly as you possibly can. But my government is telling me it doesn\u2019t really matter. \u201cWe will get to enjoy a beautiful summer if everyone just gets one vaccine. But not everyone, just 70 per cent, and not really 70 per cent, but just 70 per cent of everyone who is eligible. So, what is it?\u201d He said even if the UCP allows festivals, concerts and other big events to go on, he won\u2019t be attending. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable heading out into these large, public gatherings with just a single dose.\u201d"},

Going a long time without a haircut often results in split ends, but the lack of hair processes and use of chemicals could actually make the hair healthier, said Dr. Julia Carroll, a Toronto-based dermatologist. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look as nice because \u2026 you might have more greys or white hair, but sometimes the quality can be better because you give your hair a little bit of a break,\u201d she told Global News. Carroll said that the main benefit to getting any hair treatment such as cutting dead ends or adding highlights, was primarily aesthetic. Dean Lianos, a salon owner in Toronto, is busy getting things ready for reopening on July 6. His salon is fully booked until mid-August and his clients are \u201cinterested in getting as much done as possible\u201d, he says. Lianos, who has been in the salon business for the past 25 years, expects he and his staff will have their hands full once they are up and running again.  , personal care services, where face coverings can be worn at all times, are allowed to operate at 25 per cent capacity \u2014 with other restrictions. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a little bit of time to get used to the pace that we were used to before,\u201d Lianos told Global News. \u201cPeople have way-overgrown hair, and it\u2019s quite a big job just \u2026 starting with getting rid of all that hair,\u201d he added. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In Manitoba, personal services businesses such as hair and nail salons, estheticians and barbers are permitted to reopen at 50 per cent capacity on an appointment basis only. Winnipegger Nelson Reis, who hadn\u2019t had a haircut since February this year, got six inches chopped off by his regular hairdresser on Tuesday evening. As an IT professional, he said working from home has changed his habits over the past year. \u201cI\u2019m not washing my hair every day, so that\u2019s a difference,\u201d the 50-year-old said. Meanwhile, recovered\u00a0 \u00a0patients have also  . Carroll said this was the case with quite a few of her patients who were   \u2014 people who experience symptoms for many weeks or even months after getting the disease. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t This can happen as a result of a stress response. When the body is busy looking after vital organs, it will take resources that would normally go towards growing hair and divert to help repair other systems in the body that were damaged, she explained. But most of the patients in that boat have since recovered from it, Carroll added. Amid the soaring demand for personal care services and a rush to book appointments, Carroll recommended spacing out the treatments to allow your body time to get used to them, especially after a long hiatus. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t been doing a lot of these things for a long period of time, like facials, manicures, pedicures, hair services, then I wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to stack them all up at one time because it might be too hard on your skin or too hard on your nails,\u201d she said. For Lake, who describes herself as low maintenance, a new haircut on July 9 will mean slowly getting back to her pre-pandemic self. \u201cIt\u2019s nicer to look at yourself when you like your hair,\u201d she said, laughing."},

The \u201cimpact of transmission\u201d when it comes to the variants of concern (VOC) is \u201cfar greater,\u201d she said, adding that we need more than just ramped-up vaccination efforts to combat the super spreaders. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Does that mean we are looking at another nationwide lockdown? It\u2019s possible, said Dr. Hota. \u201cWe are looking at some pretty frightening times in the healthcare system, even if we have a strict lockdown in place starting today,\u201d she said. What we need now are \u201cstricter public health measures and social distancing rules,\u201d Dr. Hota added. In Ontario alone, 67 per cent of all COVID-19 infections are dominated by the VOC, with B.1.1.7 being the most prevalent, she said. \u201cHospitalizations are up by 20 per cent and ICU occupancy is up by 28 per cent in Ontario. We are seeing the impacts on the hospital sector more strongly with these VOCs than it was previously,\u201d she said. It\u2019s of utmost importance now more than ever that we refrain from socializing, she added. The ICUs in Ontario are \u201cat the highest census of COVID-19 positive patients right now; higher than we have ever seen,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI cannot stress enough on the importance of following public health guidelines and staying home.\u201d \u201cWe are hitting the threshold where we won\u2019t have enough people to care for patients.\u201d Dr. Hota also emphasized on the need to vaccinate essential workers and younger Canadians as an important measure to curb the spread of variants. \u201cWe have to target essential workers, more exposed individuals,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile our approach to rolling out vaccination for the older and most vulnerable is correct, we also have to vaccinate the age groups that are being more infected by the variants, which of late, has been younger people,\u201d she said. As of Tuesday, Canada saw a a total of 10,233 variant of concern (VOC) cases reported across all provinces, including 9,461 involving B.1.1.7 variants, 467 P.1 variants and 305 B.1.351 variants, according to a statement released Wednesday by Canada\u2019s top doctor Theresa Tam. Several provinces are introducing fresh efforts to curb the spread. Alberta, for instance, is screening every COVID-19-positive case for variants and reporting a variant of concern case \u201cwithout waiting for full sequencing if the screening identifies characteristic mutations,\u201d a spokesperson for Alberta Health told Global News in an emailed statement Wednesday. \u201cUnlike other provinces, this means that the vast majority of VOCs are reported immediately, with only a small number needing to follow up testing for confirmation,\u201d the statement said. In an email to Global News, a spokesperson for the British Columbia Health Services Authority, said the majority of samples it receives are screened for the variants of concern.The agency said the screening to detect the variants \u201ctakes about 24 (hours) at present.\u201d \u201cThese samples undergo analysis by whole genome sequencing to further characterize and understand the type of variant it is,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThis process takes about a week.\u201d Positive COVID-19 samples are screened for variants daily in B.C. Currently, the screening taking place at three labs across the province.\u00a0The agency said it reports variant cases to the PHAC weekly. New\u00a0variants\u00a0first detected in countries like Brazil, South Africa, Nigeria and Britain have cropped up spontaneously in Canada over the last year. All share some of the same mutations in the region of the virus used to enter and infect cells. However, unlike other variants, the one from South Africa carries numerous wide-ranging mutations. As the virus tries to spread and thrive, it undergoes tiny genetic changes, giving rise to the K417N, E484K and N501Y variants. The B.1.1.7 or the U.K. variant, on the other hand, accounts for faster transmissibility and is often linked to higher risks of hospitalizations and deaths. According to a study published by the journal Nature, the strain is, on average, 55-per cent deadlier than earlier versions of the virus. Depending on how it\u2019s measured, the study suggests it can be anywhere between 40 and 70 per cent more transmissible than the original strain. Earlier this week, more than 7,100 cases of variants of concern (VOC) were reported across Canada, with the B.1.1.7 variant responsible for over 90 per cent of those cases. They make up a \u201chigh proportion of new reported cases in the most heavily impacted provinces,\u201d Dr. Tam had said, adding stronger measures are needed to control the spread of these variants. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying all along that if we ease measures too soon, before enough people are vaccinated, the epidemic will resurge even stronger,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the increasing circulation of highly contagious variants, the threat of uncontrolled epidemic growth is significantly elevated. This is why measures must be stronger, stricter, and sustained long enough to suppress rapid epidemic growth of variants of concern.\u201d The appearance of similar mutations, independent of one another shows the coronavirus is undergoing \u201cconvergent evolution,\u201d according to some scientists interviewed by Reuters. However, although the virus will continue to mutate, immunologists and virologists said they suspect this coronavirus has a fixed number of moves in its arsenal. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The long-term impact for the virus\u2019 survival, and whether a limit on the number of mutations makes it less dangerous, remains to be seen. \u201cIt is plausible that this virus has a relatively limited number of antibody escape mutations it can make before it has played all of its cards, so to speak,\u201d said Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego."},

{"title": "Johnson & Johnson\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine will soon arrive in Canada. Here\u2019s what we know - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted April 1, 2021 5:55 am", "body": "Canada will soon add another   to its supply, with procurement minister Anita Anand announcing this week that initial shipments of   single-dose jab are to arrive by the end of April. Canada approved the vaccine in early March and had pre-ordered 10 million doses, but manufacturing problems from the company led to shipment delays to Canada and elsewhere. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Anand did not have details when she made her announcement Tuesday about how many doses would be included in the first shipment. Johnson & Johnson gives Canada four distinct vaccines \u2014 along with Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca \u2014 and its one-and-done element adds flexibility to the country\u2019s plan to immunize the majority of its residents by September. Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti, an infectious disease expert in Mississauga, Ont., says that while the vaccines are arriving later than expected, they\u2019ll be a welcome addition to Canada\u2019s rollout. \u201cA single-dose vaccine, as well as the fact it only requires a regular fridge (to store it), that is so huge in terms of taking this vaccine and bringing it to targeted populations,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish it was (arriving before) the end of April, but I\u2019ll take it.\u201d Here\u2019s what we know about Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine: Johnson & Johnson announced promising results from its Phase 3 clinical trials at the end of January, suggesting its vaccine reduced severe COVID-19 disease by 85 per cent, and prevented 100 per cent of COVID-related hospitalization or death. The vaccine had a 72 per cent efficacy in preventing COVID infections after 28 days in the company\u2019s U.S. trials. The efficacy dropped to 66 per cent when averaging in results from other global trials, including a South African study that factored in more transmissible variants of the COVID virus. Pfizer and Moderna showed 95 per cent efficacy in their respective trials, but those were tested against previous dominant strains and didn\u2019t account for variants that have popped up since. Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca also had zero hospitalizations and deaths in their trials. Chakrabarti says it\u2019s important to distinguish the timing of the four trials, and stressed that they all work exceedingly well the metrics that matter most. \u201cAll four of these vaccines \u2026 are exceptionally effective at preventing hospitalization and death,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the two things that we care about.\u201d The ease of distribution offered by a single-dose shot _ unlike the two-dose vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca _ and its ability to be stored in a regular fridge are among Johnson & Johnson\u2019s biggest strengths. Pfizer\u2019s vaccine initially required ultra-cold storage temperatures between -60 C and -80 C, though Health Canada recently said it could be stored in a regular freezer for up to 14 days. Moderna\u2019s vaccine can also be stored at regular freezer temperatures while AstraZeneca can be stored in a fridge. Chakrabarti says Johnson & Johnson\u2019s product is conducive to large, mobile vaccine clinics that can be set up quickly to target populations in hard-hit communities, especially essential workers. \u201cYou can transport the vaccine there and just boom, boom, boom, get it into people\u2019s arms,\u201d he said. \u201cThe timing doesn\u2019t help _ we really wanted to start (vaccinating) essential workers as quickly as possible \u2026 But it\u2019s something you can do (easily) with J&J.\u201d Chakrabarti added that Johnson & Johnson may also benefit from not having the string of confusing messaging surrounding it that AstraZeneca has had. Canada\u2019s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has set age recommendations on AstraZeneca three times. The latest recommendation is to pause the use of AstraZeneca in those under 55 due to rare blood clot links that were observed in Europe. Omar Khan, an assistant professor in biomedical engineering at the University of Toronto, says Johnson & Johnson could slot into the void left by provinces not using AstraZeneca on those under 55. \u201cThat (decision by NACI) effectively reduced our vaccine supply,\u201d Khan said. \u201cBut with this we can make up that loss of supply for that population and hopefully get us back on track.\u201d The fact that Johnson & Johnson is already in use in the U.S. may give Canadians more confidence in it, Chakrabarti says. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The FDA approved Johnson & Johnson on Feb. 27, but shipments to the U.S. were also affected by manufacturing problems early on. The bulk of vaccine use in the U.S. has been Pfizer and Moderna. \u201cIt\u2019s very good when you see other countries having experience with it,\u201d he said, adding that a mountain of positive AstraZeneca data also exists from the U.K., as well as data from Israel on the high effectiveness of Pfizer. Unlike the mRNA used in Pfizer and Moderna\u2019s products, Johnson & Johnson is a non-replicating viral vector vaccine similar to AstraZeneca\u2019s. That means it uses a different harmless virus, which can\u2019t copy itself, as a vector to give our cells the instructions they need to make the coronavirus\u2019s spike protein. The immune system recognizes the protein and makes antibodies, which then allow us to fend off attack if exposed in the future. Khan says it takes a couple weeks for the body to build up immunity with any of the vaccines, but those receiving Johnson & Johnson should especially take note of that. \u201cYes, it\u2019s one dose so people might say \u2018one and done, ready to go,\u2019 but you still need to give yourself the bare minimum two weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cIdeally, give yourself a month, and then you\u2019ll have a higher level of protection.\u201d"},
{"title": "Fact check: Can COVID-19 tests be tricked by the influenza virus and other questions answered  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted November 23, 2020 6:00 am", "body": "Misinformation about the flu and COVID-19 have been around since the start of the novel   pandemic, but now that flu season is upon us, it\u2019s time to fact check some myths. \u00a0 The type of test that Canada is using, the nasal swab test, is specifically designed to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for  . The test does this by detecting a very specific genetic sequence in SARS-CoV-2, a genetic sequence that influenza and common cold viruses do not have. \u201cThese genes provide viruses with proteins that allow them to make more copies of themselves, dictate which types of cells they can infect, and can interfere with the circuitry that our cells use to mount immune responses against them,\u201d said Dr. Jason Kindrachuk, assistant professor in the department of medical microbiology at the University of Manitoba. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like two bestselling fiction novels \u2014 they can both come from the same section of the book store and attract a certain type of reader. However, when you open them up, the words on the pages result in two very different stories.\u201d In other words, the test that we use looks only for the coronavirus, not influenza, and therefore, influenza cannot produce a false positive. \u00a0 There are several reasons why the flu isn\u2019t spreading, said Kindrachuk. \u201cThis is a result of the additional protective measures that we\u2019re all participating in for COVID-19: distancing, masking, limited time in enclosed areas with low ventilation, hygiene, etc.,\u201d Kindrachuk said. \u201cSeasonal influenza viruses, while transmitted in a similar way to SARS-CoV-2, appear to be transmitted to a lower number of people per infectious person.\u201d This means, of course, that the fewer people who get influenza, the fewer people will be infected in the community. Add in protective measures we\u2019ve already been doing since March, and you get a slower spread of the virus, said Kindrachuk. \u201cWe also have the advantage with influenza viruses of pre-existing immunity through our natural exposure to these viruses during our lifetimes and as well through prior and current vaccinations. \u201cWith COVID-19, we don\u2019t have that buffer of pre-existing immunity in our communities, nor licensed vaccines.\u201d \u00a0 According to Canada Public Health, about 3,500 people die yearly from influenza in Canada. As of Nov. 19, there have been about 11,500 deaths from COVID-19 in Canada since March. COVID-19 is a deadly virus.  If you get infected in Manitoba, you have a 1 in 59 chance of dying.  If you infect someone you love, they have a 1 in 59 chance of dying.  1 in 59. Stop the spread. Follow Dr.  's advice.  Stay home. Save lives.  Please.  \u2014 Doctors Manitoba (@DoctorsManitoba)  \u00a0 \u201cSo we\u2019ve known from early on \u2026 COVID-19 is very serious and causes significant mortality in people who have pre-existing lung disease and some other conditions like morbid obesity,\u201d said Dr.  Alan Katz, director of the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy Last week in Manitoba, a woman in her 30s and a child under 10 died from COVID-19. A man in his 20s was also reported dead, but that was corrected later by the province as a clerical error. Unfortunately, said Katz, those who have had mild illnesses have enhanced the myth that younger people don\u2019t become seriously ill from the virus. \u201cWe know from evidence coming out now that many people who are infected with this illness end up having long-term consequences of it,\u201d said Katz. \u201cAnd these are quite varied and very concerning and not predictable by the severity of the initial illness. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing people who have mild illness, who don\u2019t need hospitalization at all, also have long-term consequences. \u201cThat\u2019s very concerning, because the whole idea of saying, you know, \u2018Let people get a mild form of this illness and then everybody will be fine and immune\u2019 isn\u2019t true,\u201d said Katz."},

{"title": "Coronavirus: What is herd immunity and what does it mean for COVID-19? - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted April 11, 2020 2:03 pm", "body": "As the novel   continues to spread in Canada and around the globe, the concept of herd immunity has been put into the spotlight. In Canada, officials have shuttered schools and all non-essential businesses, have limited all non-essential travel and have urged the public to practice physical distancing in order to stem the spread of  and give researchers time to develop a vaccine. But, if scientists aren\u2019t successful in creating a vaccine, the country would need to develop what is known as natural herd immunity in order for the pandemic to end. What is herd immunity and what does it mean for  ? Here\u2019s what experts say. Kwong said if you have enough people who are immune in the population, then the infection won\u2019t spread as easily. \u201cOr ideally it won\u2019t spread at all,\u201d he said. Dr. Suzanne Sicchia, an associate professor at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Health and Society at the University of Toronto Scarborough said the larger the proportion of people in the population who have natural or vaccine-based immunity to a given infectious disease, the fewer people there are that the micro-organism or disease-causing agent could infect. \u201cIn this way, herd immunity can help to   the infectious agent in a particular population,\u201d she wrote in an email to Global News. However, Sicchia noted that elimination is not the same as eradication. \u201cElimination can be for a period of time whereas eradication refers to complete elimination of a disease in a region or globally.\u201d According to Sicchia, Canada has developed herd immunity against other viruses. \u201cHerd immunity happens whenever a BIG chunk of the population has been vaccinated for example,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd of course we have eradicated both Smallpox and Polio!\u201d Since the novel coronavirus outbreak began, researchers have been working tirelessly to develop a vaccine in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It is estimated it will be made available for use sometime in the next two years. However, if researchers are unable to successfully develop a vaccine, Kwong said Canada would need to develop herd immunity in order for the pandemic to end. He said in order for that to happen, around half of the country\u2019s population would need to develop immunity. \u201cSo operating on the assumption that they do have protection after you\u2019ve had the virus once, it\u2019s probably going to be more than 50 per cent,\u201d he said. But, Kwong said researchers are not sure how long the immunity lasts. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone knows,\u201d he said. \u201cI think especially because this is a new virus, we don\u2019t know \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Another unknown, Kwong said, is how many people in Canada may already have developed immunity to the virus. He said researchers are already hard at work trying to determine exactly what percentage of the population has already had the infection and would be considered protected from COVID-19. However, it is possible, Kwong said, that even those who have had the virus may not be immune. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know \u2014 we just don\u2019t know right now. Some countries \u2014 including the U.K. \u2014 have considered not implementing these types of measures, and have instead looked into allowing the virus to spread widely, to develop herd immunity. Sicchia said this strategy is \u201ccompletely wrong-headed and dangerous.\u201d Kwong, too, called the idea \u201cdangerous.\u201d \u201cThe whole idea of flattening the curve is that you don\u2019t allow too many people to get very sick at the same time.\u201d He said if more people are sick than the health system can handle, then a \u201clot of people die.\u201d Sicchia said \u201cthankfully\u201d the U.K. recognized this was a \u201cserious mis-step and changed their course.\u201d According to Sicchia, physical distancing along with other public health measures including widespread testing, social isolation after travel, and practising good hand and respiratory hygiene, paired with bolstering the health care sector, is the most effective route to ending the pandemic. On Friday, the Canadian government released models which suggested the first wave of the virus could end this summer. Prime Minister   said based on these projections, some measures may be able to be loosened in the summer, but said Canada will not be able to return to the normal \u201cwe had before\u201d until a vaccine is developed.

This is up 17,615 tests from the previous day, which is back around the number of tests completed daily that Ontario was seeing a couple of weeks back. The province has said it has a testing capacity of over 21,000 tests. Thursday\u2019s report marks an increase of 1.4 per cent in total cumulative cases. That figure has mostly hovered between 1.1 and 1.8 over the past week. Ontario has 833 patients (down by 14) hospitalized due to COVID-19, with 137 patients in an intensive care unit (down by 17) and 94 patients in ICUs on a ventilator (down by 23). Overall hospitalizations have significantly decreased since the previous report. According to the Ministry of Long-Term Care, there have been 1,591 deaths reported among residents and patients in long-term care homes across Ontario, which is an increase of four deaths, and there are 129 current outbreaks. Six health-care workers in long-term care homes have died. Ontario officials have said there may be a discrepancy between overall deaths and deaths at long-term care homes due to how the province\u2019s health database system, called iPHIS, is tracking data and how the Ministry of Long-Term Care is tracking data. The ministry also indicated there are currently 1,655 confirmed cases among long-term care residents and 1,160 cases among staff. Health-care workers in Ontario account for 4,577 of the total reported cases, which is 17 per cent of the infected population. Greater Toronto Area public health units account for 65 per cent of all cases in the province. Here is a breakdown of Ontario cases by gender and age: There are 11,868 people currently under investigation awaiting test results. The newly reported numbers are valid as of 2 p.m. Wednesday for Toronto and Ottawa public health units, and 4 p.m. for the rest of the province."},

This is well short of the 19,000 daily tests the province said it would be completing by mid-April and is raising concerns health officials aren\u2019t capturing the full spread of the virus. The latest Health Canada data for Ontario shows the 2,930 new tests are less than 20 per cent of the total daily testing capacity in the province of over 13,000. It\u2019s also just over half the daily target of 5,000 that the government promised to target for the first week of April. And although Ontario has tested over 82,000 people, the province continues to face widespread criticism for lagging behind all other provinces in testing. As of Monday, Ontario had completed 510 tests for every 100,000 residents. Alberta has done nearly 1,500 tests per 100,000 while B.C. has done 950 tests per 100,000. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said Wednesday afternoon that his \u201cpatience was running thin\u201d with the low amount of testing in the province, calling it \u201cunacceptable.\u201d \u201cThere are no more excuses for why we are testing 3,000 a day. We need to see 13,000 people tested every single day moving forward,\u201d Ford said, adding that health-care workers in long-term care facilities should be prioritized. \u201cWe are going forward on a rapid fashion to make sure every single person possible can get tested,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter our front-line health-care workers and first-responders, we need to be testing everyone.\u201d Experts say they are concerned not just by the falling test numbers, but also by the rising proportion of positive tests in the province, which jumped up to a daily record of around 13 per cent on Tuesday. Quebec, which has recently ramped up testing, has a positive rate of over 17 per cent. The World Health Organization and epidemiologists say jurisdictions should be aiming for a positive test rate of roughly 10 per cent to ensure officials are getting the most accurate picture of the spread of the virus and not missing cases. \u201cGiven that we\u2019ve got this ongoing community spread, we need to be testing aggressively and not just restricting it to those hospitalized patients who are sick, and hospital staff,\u201d Peter Phillips, a professor in infectious diseases at the University of British Columbia, told Global News in a recent interview. \u201cIf we don\u2019t know where it is out there, we can\u2019t contain it.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Anna Banerji, an infectious disease specialist and associate professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s faculty of medicine, said there could be \u201cmany people\u201d who may have had   who haven\u2019t been tested. Banerji said the lower test rates could also be attributed to people being discouraged from getting tested after the province shifted its strategy. Ontario is now giving priority for testing to hospital patients and health-care workers. \u201cTesting is limited right now to certain higher-risk groups,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are many, many people out there that have had coronavirus either mildly or asymptomatic that haven\u2019t been tested.\u201d On Wednesday, Ontario reported its largest daily increase with  , bringing the total number of cases in the province to 5,276, including 174 deaths and 2,074 recoveries. The province also reduced its massive backlog of tests from over 10,000 last week to just over 1,000. Ford said he would be on the testing issue like \u201ca dog on a bone.\u201d \u201cWhat are we going to do moving? We are going to make sure more people are tested,\u201d he said. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases specialist at the University Health Network, welcomed Ford\u2019s change in tone and said the lack of testing was \u201cinexcusable\u201d as COVID-19 infections continued to rise. \u201cHow do you know your curve is being flattened? How do you know how well you\u2019re doing if you can\u2019t see what you\u2019re fighting,\u201d he said. \u201cThis data is extremely helpful to get a granular picture of what is happening.\u201d Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott told reporters Tuesday afternoon her government was looking to lessen any restrictions that are in place with regards to testing protocols for vulnerable populations \u2014 like those in long-term care homes and at assessment centres. \u201cWe are looking at the current situation. We are increasing our testing, particularly in areas that are most vulnerable,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cWe have developed a strategy in order to be able to increase that testing there.\u201d Ontario\u2019s NDP called on the Ford government Wednesday to immediately test more people for COVID-19. \u201cWe need to expand testing so we have a clear picture on how widespread COVID-19 is in the province,\u201d NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said in a statement. \u201cOntario needs to do literally everything possible to protect our health care heroes, first responders and vulnerable seniors.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Ontario\u2019s associate chief medical officer of health, said Monday that officials are currently reassessing the testing criteria to allow more people to be tested, but said the testing strategy needs to avoid ending up with another backlog. \u201cNow that the testing capacity has gone up, we want to expand who is tested but in a way that is controlled so we don\u2019t end up with a backlog,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cWe know we can expand, we just have to come up with specific groups and how to do it and that will be communicated out very quickly. In the meantime, the assessment are aware that there is increased capacity and we are certainly saying if you are concerned about this person, please do test them.\u201d"},

The temporary program is aimed at helping employers reduce payroll deductions and retain workers amid the  , which has sickened more 349,000 worldwide, including over 1,400 cases confirmed cases in Canada, as of Monday morning. However, business groups and experts say much more needs to be done to prevent massive layoffs. Here is what small business owners need to know about accessing the wage subsidy: Small businesses will get wage support by reducing how much they hand over in payroll deductions to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) rather than receiving a government cheque. The subsidy is equal to 10 per cent of the remuneration paid between March 18 and June 20, 2020, up to $1,375 per employee and a maximum of $25,000 total per employer, according to the CRA. Using the CRA\u2019s example, a company with five employees will be able to receive a maximum subsidy of $6,875 (or $1,375 per employee). Businesses are required to do the math themselves for the total subsidy, based on CRA guidelines. Once a company has done the calculations, it can reduce its current remittance of federal, provincial or territorial income tax sent to the CRA.\u00a0 Companies can\u2019t reduce Canada Pension Plan contributions or employment insurance (EI) premiums. \u201cIf you calculated a subsidy of $2,050, you would reduce your current remittance of federal, provincial or territorial income tax by $2,050,\u201d the CRA said. \u201cYou could continue reducing future income tax remittances, up to the maximum of $25,000, for all remuneration paid before June 20, 2020.\u201d The tax agency says employers are eligible to receive the benefit if they meet the following criteria: Private companies are eligible for the subsidy if their\u00a0earnings and other capital in Canada for the last year is less than $15 million. The CRA also said companies who are closed or did not pay salary, wages, bonuses or other remuneration to an employee between March 18 and June 20, 2020 cannot receive the benefit. Eligible employers will need to keep the following for their bookkeeping: The CRA says more information on how to report this subsidy \u201cwill be released in the near future.\u201d Last week, a half-million Canadian workers filed for EI benefits in just a four-day period, as evidence of the historic job losses related to COVID-19 quickly came into focus. Employment and Social Development Canada said on Friday that the department received about 500,000 applications for EI, compared with just 27,000 in the same week a year ago. Dan Kelly, president of the   (CFIB), said the subsidy is \u201cwildly inadequate\u201d given the economic crisis COVID-19 has created. \u201cWe have at least half the economy shut down with no business income, and I think it\u2019s probably more than that now,\u201d Kelly told Global News. \u201cMany small businesses have been trying to make do since their revenue fell off a cliff last week.\u201d Kelly said his organization has received calls from 600 small and medium-sized business owners worried they will not be able to survive the coming weeks. The CFIB normally receives 50 calls a day, according to Kelly. Benjamin Bergen, executive director with the Council of Canadian Innovators (CCI), said the wage subsidies need to be significant enough to \u201cfreeze the economy\u201d to help keep businesses afloat and fuel the economic recovery when the pandemic is over. The CFIB, CCI and others have called on the Trudeau government to follow the lead of some European countries and cover a larger portion of the payroll. Denmark, for example, is planning to cover 75 per cent of salaried workers\u2019 pay, capped at roughly $4,700 a month, while Britain has said it will cover up to 80 per cent. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Sunday the government has \u201cnot ruled out anything\u201d when it comes to further help for employers. \u201cWe are continuing to talk about next steps, looking at best practices from around the world and what other countries \u2026 are doing to ensure that our economy remains solid,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cThere is no one measure that is going to be sufficient.\u201d Trudeau said Monday he will have a conference call with premiers and territorial leaders to discuss next steps on providing help for Canadians. \u201cThe premiers and I will also talk about continuing to move forward with measures to support families and small businesses to ensure our economy rebounds,\u201d he said Kelly urged Ottawa to act now to prevent millions of Canadians from being laid off. \u201cIf they act next week or the week after, it\u2019s going to be too late,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t move on this quickly, the consequences are going to be terrible for employers and employees.\u201d"},

The increased effort includes walk-in Wednesday on Aug. 4 across the province with 20,000 shots available and no need to book ahead. The province is also slightly reducing the interval between first and second doses, from eight weeks to seven weeks. British Columbians now must wait at least 49 days between   shots. Following the two-week blitz and with lower demand for shots, BC will shift the balance to fewer large mass clinics and greater use of public health clinics, outreach clinics, mobiles, and pop-ups. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Changes in clinic locations and size will occur through August and September. In late August and September, there will be a major focus on young people returning to post-secondary institutions and schools. As of Tuesday morning, there are 906,772 eligible people who have not received their first dose, 19.6 per cent of the 12 plus population. Northern and Interior health continue to lag behind the other regions in the province. There is 32.5 per cent of the Northern health population unvaccinated and 26.2 per cent of the Interior health population. The province provided numbers again showing less than 5 per cent of COVID-19 cases in B.C. are among fully vaccinated people. From June 15 to July 15, just 68 people got sick seven days after receiving a second COVID vaccine dose. During the same time period, 1,210 unvaccinated people got sick and 499 people who had received just one dose got sick. Over the month recording period, 137 unvaccinated were hospitalized, 31 partially vaccinated went to the hospital with COVID, and eight fully vaccinated people were hospitalized. \u201cThere is more work to do if we\u2019re going to protect each other from the variants and put the pandemic behind us,\u201d reads a presentation from the province on the vaccination plan. On Tuesday morning, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau   to immunize every eligible person in the country. Speaking from the vaccine clinic at the Moncton Coliseum in New Brunswick, Trudeau said the country has now received more than 66 million doses. Currently, Canadians aged 12 and up are eligible for the vaccine. Those under 18 are only able to get Pfizer. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Elsewhere, there are more calls for Canada to implement a \u201ccentralized, Canada-wide approach\u201d to be used to confirm vaccination status internationally and domestically. In a letter to Trudeau and B.C. Premier John Horgan, Surrey Board of Trade CEO Anita Huberman writes that without interprovincial harmonization, Canada risks making life unpredictable for individuals and employers during an \u201calready uncertain time.\u201d \u201cImplementing proof-of-immunization would both encourage more Canadians to get vaccinated and allow more businesses to safely reopen and remain open with the possibility of future outbreaks still uncertain,\u201d Huberman said in a release on Monday. Currently, B.C. is advising those who have not been fully immunized to wear masks indoors, while those who have had both shots are not required to do so. The challenge is there is no tool to publicly determine who has or has not been vaccinated. Henry was also asked about Quebec offering a third dose of mRNA vaccine to help people whose vaccinations are not recognized if they want to travel. Some places in the European Union and the United States are considering not allowing access to people who have mixed and matched vaccines or who have received AstraZeneca. Health officials across the country are working on this and Henry described the situation as \u2018very much in flux\u2019. \u201cRight now we just need to be patient. We are working with Canada, and Canada is working internationally to make sure that we all adhere to the standard,\u201d Henry said. \u201cWhat I would like to see is WHO-approved vaccines in any combination, and we are seeing that. We are not the only country that is using AstraZeneca. We are not the only people that are using mix and match schedules, whether that is Moderna/Pfizer or AstraZeneca/Moderna or Pfizer.\u201d"},

Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health also announced four new deaths recorded over the weekend, two on Friday, and two Sunday, bringing the total of Albertans who have died from COVID-19 to 234. \u201cMy sympathies go out to all who lost loved ones this weekend,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cToday, there are 1,172 active cases in the province. Forty-five people are in the hospital, including nine in intensive care.\u201d The two deaths Friday were both women at the Good Samaritan Southgate Care Centre in Edmonton zone, one who was in her 80s and a second in her 100s. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The two deaths Sunday were a man in his 70s in the North zone and a woman in her 70s in the South zone.

On Monday, Hinshaw said she has been receiving questions from Albertans as to why cases continue to rise in the capital region. She pointed to a \u201cparticularly high\u201d attack rate of the virus linked to family gatherings in Edmonton, including weddings and funerals. \u201cWe are hardwired to want to be together,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cHowever, when organized by even the most well-meaning family members, it can be challenging to maintain physical distance with loved ones. It\u2019s natural for families to want to move gatherings indoors when the weather cools. \u201cWhen we let our guard down, the virus has its opportunity.\u201d Hinshaw suggested all Albertans should try to keep gatherings small and outdoors when possible. \u201cAsking someone to wash their hands or reminding them to maintain two metres of physical distance is the most loving thing we can do at the moment,\u201d she said. Hinshaw also suggested if people do hold gatherings, they should keep a recorded list of who attends in case of the virus. \u201cQuick access to accurate information speeds up contact tracing immensely,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has the potential to save lives.\u201d She added that in the Edmonton zone, there has also been an uptick in cases spreading among young adults. \u201cIt is easy to feel invincible and believe that COVID-19 is only a concern for older Albertans,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is easy to forget the virus\u2019 potential to cause harm if you don\u2019t know anyone who has suffered from it, it is easy to believe this is someone else\u2019s issue. \u201cBecause of the way the virus is spreading in your age group, you are now more likely to pass on this virus unknowingly, and to do so rapidly,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cWe are seeing this in Edmonton right now. You must keep your circle of friends small to protect others from the virus.\u201d Out of the total cases in Alberta, 56 per cent have been recorded in people between the ages of 20 and 49. \u201cCritically, if you\u2019re feeling even a bit under the weather, don\u2019t go out,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cStay at home and arrange to be tested. And although we\u2019re seeing these trends in Edmonton right now, tomorrow, they could be in other communities.\u201d Hinshaw also warned against those outside of Calgary and Edmonton zones on becoming complacent. \u201cIt can be easy to think of COVID-19 as a city problem, and the virus will not show up in rural Alberta,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are 185 active cases right now outside of Edmonton and Calgary, and when precautions aren\u2019t taken, we have seen even a single case quickly multiple to many more.\u201d In total, 717,514 tests for COVID-19 have been completed in Alberta. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The entire city of Edmonton remains under "},

The study, released on Saturday, compared almost 400 people who had tested positive for COVID-19, 14 days or more after they received one or two doses of the vaccine, against the same number of unvaccinated patients with the disease. It matched age and gender, among other characteristics. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The South African variant, B.1.351, was found to make up about one per cent of all the COVID-19 cases across all the people studied, according to the study by Tel Aviv University and Israel\u2019s largest healthcare provider, Clalit. But among patients who had received two doses of the vaccine, the variant\u2019s prevalence rate was eight times higher than those unvaccinated \u2013 5.4 per cent versus 0.7 per cent. This suggests the vaccine is less effective against the South African variant, compared with the original coronavirus and a variant first identified in Britain that has come to comprise nearly all COVID-19 cases in Israel, the researchers said. \u201cWe found a disproportionately higher rate of the South African variant among people vaccinated with a second dose, compared to the unvaccinated group. This means that the South African variant is able, to some extent, to break through the vaccine\u2019s protection,\u201d said Tel Aviv University\u2019s Adi Stern. The researchers cautioned, though, that the study only had a small sample size of people infected with the South African variant because of its rarity in Israel. They also said the research was not intended to deduce overall vaccine effectiveness against any variant, since it only looked at people who had already tested positive for COVID-19, not at overall infection rates. Pfizer and BioNTech could not be immediately reached for comment outside business hours. The companies said on April 1 that their vaccine was around 91% effective at preventing COVID-19, citing updated trial data that included participants inoculated for up to six months. In respect to the South African variant, they said that among a group of 800 study volunteers in South Africa, where B.1.351 is widespread, there were nine cases of COVID-19, all of which occurred among participants who got the placebo. Of those nine cases, six were among individuals infected with the South African variant. Some previous studies have indicated that the Pfizer/BioNTech shot was less potent against the B.1.351 variant than against other variants of the coronavirus, but still offered a robust defense. While the results of the study may cause concern, the low prevalence of the South African strain was encouraging, according to Stern. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cEven if the South African variant does break through the vaccine\u2019s protection, it has not spread widely through the population,\u201d said Stern, adding that the British variant may be \u201cblocking\u201d the spread of the South African strain. Almost 53 per cent of Israel\u2019s 9.3 million population has received both Pfizer doses. Israel has largely reopened its economy in recent weeks while the pandemic appears to be receding, with infection rates, severe illness and hospitalizations dropping sharply. About a third of Israelis are below the age of 16, which means they are still not eligible for the shot."},

The milestone comes amid another 126 deaths reportedly linked to the virus, which pushes the national death toll to 13,109. Thursday\u2019s fatalities now stand as the highest daily reported death toll in seven months, after 139 more deaths were reported on June 4. Another 6,738 new cases of COVID-19 were also announced by health authorities Thursday, raising Canada\u2019s total infections to 441,705. To date, over 355,000 patients have since recovered from the virus, however, while another 15.9 million tests have been administered. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Thursday\u2019s grim milestone comes just 11 days after the country\u2019s previous one, in which COVID-19 deaths surpassed the 12,000-mark. Several new announcements on Thursday also came amid the rise in cases, deaths and hospitalizations in Canadian communities. In a press conference, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that his government would be footing the bill over the costs of the coronavirus vaccine, including the costs of supplies to administer them. The announcement comes just hours after a first ministers meeting, in which the prime minister was expected to address the long-term health-care funding with the country\u2019s premiers. \u201cThe meeting of today gave us the opportunity to talk about our work in common to fight this pandemic and what we\u2019re doing to help Canadians and Canadian businesses during this crisis,\u201d said Trudeau, who noted again that the vaccine would be completely free for all Canadians. Premiers were quick to express disappointment Thursday however after the prime minister did not agree to the premiers\u2019 demands of another $28 billion in funding each year for annual federal transfers for health care. The government has already spent hundreds of billions to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as previously directing $25 billion in funding to provinces and territories to boost their health systems, among other things. The prime minister did agree with ministers\u2019 sentiments to increase federal health funding, but said that he would be willing to address the issue once the pandemic is over. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Trudeau also announced a new \u201cpan-Canadian\u201d program to address any injuries from the vaccine, but stressed that the Health-Canada approved Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was safe and effective. \u201cAfter being vaccinated, it\u2019s common to have mild and harmless side effects \u2014 this is the body\u2019s natural response, as it\u2019s working to build immunity against a disease. However, it is also possible for someone to have a serious adverse reaction to a vaccine,\u201d read a statement from the Public Health Agency of Canada which announced the program. \u201cThe chances of this are extremely rare \u2014 less than one in a million \u2014 and we have a duty to help if this occurs.\u201d Initial doses of Pfizer\u2019s coronavirus vaccine were also confirmed to be arriving on Monday, Canada\u2019s procurement minister confirmed. \u201cThis has been a wonderful week for Canadians. We are going to have vaccines in this country on Monday,\u201d said Anita Anand while speaking during question period in the House of Commons Thursday. Pfizer\u2019s vaccine was only approved Wednesday by Health Canada, with government officials announcing that it would begin rolling out to priority groups \u201cwithin days.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 Several other vaccine candidates are still being reviewed by Health Canada, including ones from Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, though it is still unclear if those treatments would be approved by the end of this year. Virus cases continue to reach record numbers across Canada, with Ontario hitting a new daily high of 1,983 more cases Thursday. Another 35 deaths were also reported, raising the provincial death toll to 3,871. Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the province would begin to administer its first shots of the Pfizer vaccine at hospitals in Toronto and Ottawa Tuesday. According to retired general Rick Hillier, who is heading Ontario\u2019s vaccination program, a total of 6,000 doses would arrive Monday to be split between Toronto and Ottawa, while another 90,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine was expected to arrive in province over the course of December. Hillier also noted on Thursday that Moderna\u2019s approval was not going to be \u201cfar behind the Pfizer approval\u201d and that expected it to be approved for use in Canada by the end of December for initial use in long-term care home sites. Quebec added another 1,842 cases on Thursday as well as 33 more deaths. The province, which has been the hardest hit part of Canada in terms of both virus deaths and cases, also faced scrutiny Thursday over how its long-term care system fared during initial on-set of the pandemic. According to a new report from Ombudsman Marie Rinfret, Quebec\u2019s system failed to ensure long-term care home residents\u2019 safety during the initial spread of the virus. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Alberta reported 1,566 more cases and another 13 deaths linked to COVID-19. Health authorities in the province also announced they would start distributing their initial supply of 3,900 vaccines next week to front-line health-care workers. Saskatchewan reported 324 more cases and Manitoba another 292, raising their infection totals to 11,223 and 19,947, respectively. British Columbia added another 722 cases of the virus Thursday, raising its total confirmed caseload to 39,696. Another 364 cases are considered \u201cepi-linked\u201d which are patients with symptoms and are close contacts of confirmed cases, but were never tested. In Atlantic Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia both added four new virus cases while Newfoundland and Labrador reported just one additional infection. P.E.I. and all of the territories did not report any cases Thursday during their daily updates. A total of 69,496,000 cases of the novel coronavirus have been diagnosed worldwide according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. To date, the virus has claimed the lives of more than 1,579,000, with the United States, Brazil and India continuing to lead in both cases and deaths. \u2014\u00a0"},

They may worry about bringing the virus home to their family if an item they were wearing or using in the hospital became contaminated. For people working in high-risk environments, Gardam recommends washing clothing as soon as you get home, and wearing comfortable clothes to work that can be cleaned easily. \u201cD on\u2019t wear ties \u2014 you can\u2019t wash ties.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve been associated with other hospital outbreaks in the past because ties are just a piece of clothing that never get washed and can get contaminated,\u201d Gardam said. Dr. Craig Janes, director of the School of Public Health and Health Systems at the University of Waterloo, echoes Gardam\u2019s stance, and said people shouldn\u2019t be overly concerned with outdoor clothing. \u201cIf items haven\u2019t been touched or handled by others outside of the household, then there should not be any need to wash them down,\u201d Janes said. For mail or packages that are delivered, the precautionary rule would be to unpack these (while not touching your face), dispose of the packaging, then wash your hands thoroughly, he said.

If you do need to touch them, wash your hands after. As of March 25, there are   of COVID-19 in Canada, according to   and provincial health officials. One hundred and eighty-five people have recovered, and 29 have died. This novel coronavirus infects the lungs, throat and nose, and can spread in two different ways, Nancy Walton, a professor and director of the Daphne Cockwell School of Nursing at Ryerson University,  . The first is through droplet transmission from someone who is infected. \u201c One is through being close to someone, and they\u2019re coughing or sneezing on you, and a droplet gets around your eyes, mouth or nose,\u201d Walton said. \u201cOr droplets get on your hands, and you then touch your eyes, mouth or nose.\u201d Another way COVID-19 can spread is through surface contact, Walton said. When someone with coronavirus sneezes or coughs, the droplets can fall onto a surrounding surface. When you are sharing food in a restaurant, for example, the droplets can get on the food, plate, cutlery or table. If you touch that contaminated surface then touch your mouth, nose or eyes, you can get COVID-19. Even though droplet transmission is known to be the main way for COVID-19 to spread, a\u00a0  by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases published on March 17 suggests that the virus remain on . The virus was viable after three days on plastic and stainless steel, and less than a day on cardboard. While experts are still learning and much is unknown about COVID-19, Gardam said Canadians shouldn\u2019t panic about grocery items\u00a0being contaminated. \u201cWe do not have good evidence about how long this coronavirus can live on surfaces in \u2018real life\u2019 contexts,\u201d Janes said. \u201cThe data we have comes from laboratory settings, and it appears from these that the virus can live for up to a couple of days on hard surfaces\u2026but it has been suggested that it is more difficult to pick up viruses from these surfaces through handling.\u201d But if it brings you peace of mind, Gardam said you can wipe down grocery items, like plastic peanut butter containers or jars, to be extra safe. Of all the safety precautions you can take to protect yourself and others from the coronavirus outbreak, though, Janes said you should prioritize frequent handwashing, avoid touching your face and regularly cleaning surfaces. \u201cPhysical/social distancing is our best (and only) tool at this point,\u201d he said.

New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador   their borders and remove   quarantine rules for travellers between the provinces by April 19. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The bubble is conditional upon low COVID-19 case numbers in the region, containment of outbreaks and ongoing advice from the chief medical officers of health. While the rest of the country grapples with the rise of new variants and  , it\u2019s a different picture on the East Coast. As of Monday, the region had a combined total of 158 active cases and 237 cases of variants of concern (VOC) in all four provinces. By comparison, Canada as a whole has 45,208 active cases and more than  . \u201cIt really is an amazing, not only national example, but international example in terms of how to manage COVID effectively,\u201d said Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto. So, how did they get here? Early on in the pandemic, the provinces swiftly moved to impose tight border restrictions with a strict mandatory 14-day quarantine for anyone entering along with tough public health measures within their borders. \u201cWe\u2019ve had very good and consistent public health advice,\u201d said Susan Kirkland, professor and head of the department of community health and epidemiology at Dalhousie University in Halifax. \u201cWe\u2019ve acted very conservatively. We\u2019ve acted very quickly,\u201d she told Global News, adding that consistent public health messaging has been received well by the Atlantic residents. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThe public has been very receptive and taken a social responsibility stance and really embraced all of the public health measures that have been put in place.\u201d Geographical location and low population density have also contributed to keeping COVID-19 at bay, experts say. The region has a total population of 2.4 million. While P.E.I. is an island itself, Nova Scotia is remotely placed on the map and connected only to New Brunswick. The cultural setup in small towns means people are used to living socially isolated lives, Kirkland noted. \u201cPeople are not congregating in large groups in the same way in public spaces in smaller communities,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, on the policy side, a clear co-ordination between the medical officers of health of the four provinces has helped steer the pandemic path in the right direction, said Furness. In early July 2020, the Atlantic provinces began to allow travel between themselves amid concerns the sudden freedom would lead to a rash of outbreaks. That did not happen. The highly-touted Atlantic bubble allowed the local economy and tourism to function, while cases and deaths remained in check. However, it has not all been smooth sailing. Last month,   in Newfoundland and Labrador was linked to the B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the United Kingdom. About 565 cases of COVID-19 are now associated with the St. John\u2019s outbreak, which began in early February, meaning it generated more new cases than the province saw in the previous 11 months. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Health authorities imposed a provincewide lockdown, prompting the cancellation of in-person voting in the provincial election. Canada\u2019s top doctor Theresa Tam noted that the rapid surge was \u201cquickly interrupted with strong and sustained community-based measures.\u201d \u201cThe Atlantic provinces have been able to sustain sufficient measures to manage importations, interrupt spreads and maintain strong control of COVID-19,\u201d Tam said during a March 26 news conference. While variant cases are quite low in P.E.I., N.S. and N.B. \u2014 with each reporting less than 30 in total \u2014 N.L. has so far reported 178 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant. National   on Friday\u00a0emphasized the threat of more transmissible and possibly more deadly virus variants, like the B.1.1.7 variant, especially for the young population. With a relatively lower prevalence of natural immunity to the virus, some experts say the Atlantic provinces need greater urgency to vaccinate. In a   by Global News, Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Sinai Health and University Health Network hospitals in Toronto, said Nova Scotia was not \u201capproaching their vaccination strategy with the same zeal as other jurisdictions.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Sinha called N.L. a \u201cmystery island\u201d because of a lack of transparency about its vaccine rollout plans and targets. Overall, N.B. has done a \u201cpretty good job\u201d of managing COVID-19 during the first and second wave,\u201d Sinha said. But it does not have the \u201csame urgency that we see in other provinces, like Ontario, Quebec, B.C. and Alberta, to get people vaccinated,\u201d he added. As border restrictions are set to be lifted next month, both Furness and Kirkland are confident the region will continue to be successful in curbing COVID-19 spread \u2013 with the same tools that have worked for them. \u201cAt this point, looking in the rearview mirror, I think the Atlantic provinces provide an excellent narrative for what we ought to have done and perhaps what we ought to do next time,\u201d said Furness."},

Rapid testing kits will be important in keeping people safe when they return to work and borders re-open, infection control epidemiologist Colin Furness said. \u201cImagine quarantining people for as long as it takes for someone to pick up their luggage at an airport, where it\u2019s either yes or no,\u201d he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Furness, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto, said portable test kits are especially useful in rural or remote communities, where quick access to hospital or test assessment centres may not be possible. \u201cThe general idea of trying to scale up capacity through rapid testing is an excellent thing,\u201d he said. Spartan Bioscience Inc., a small  , is one solution that Ontario and Alberta governments have tapped to increase testing capacity. The company\u2019s device, the Spartan Cube, is a hand-held DNA analyzer that can provide COVID-19 test results in about 30 minutes. The small grey box \u2014 about the size of a coffee can \u2014 uses a throat swab created by the company, which is then placed into a single-use cartridge and inserted into the device. Most COVID-19 tests are done using a long nasopharyngeal swab which is inserted into the nose. Swabs are then sent to a hospital or public health lab, where they are processed in a large machine designed for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. A lack of swabs, testing chemicals and limited lab space have led to backlogs in some provinces and forced public health officials to limit who gets tested. This can be a major problem when health investigators are trying to determine where the virus is in order to isolate those cases. Experts have warned Canada may be missing thousands of COVID-19 cases due to these limitations. \u201cI think everyone around the world has been caught a bit flat-footed,\u201d said Paul Lem, founder and CEO of Spartan. \u201cThat\u2019s where we have a big advantage as a Canadian company. We actually manufacture the tests and cartridges in Ottawa so we are not subject to that global supply shortage.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Several countries, like South Korea and Germany, have also banned the export of essential medical equipment and supplies. U.S. President Donald Trump banned the export of N95 masks made by 3M Co. to Canada last week. In the United States, Detroit began using new rapid testing kits for first responders, bus drivers and health-care workers to test for the new coronavirus. The test, created by Illinois-based pharmaceutical company Abbott Laboratories, can produce results in about 15 minutes or less. The company hopes to ramp up production to the point where it can deliver 50,000 kits per day, per a release. While there have been concerns with rapid testing in the  , the Spartan cube uses an identical test that has been published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which has a 100-per cent accuracy rate according to Lem. The Spartan test has not yet been approved by Health Canada, but Lem said they are in talks \u201calmost everyday\u201d and hope to get the final green light \u201cvery soon.\u201d He hopes the test kits could be shipped in the coming weeks. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Ontario has ordered over 900,000 test kits, while Alberta Health Services has signed a $9.5-million contract for 250 handheld devices, along with 100,000 test kits. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday that Canada is working on increasing testing, but didn\u2019t provide a date on when these rapid test kits might be used by public health agencies. \u201cWe recognise that large scale testing is a key element of flattening the curve and dealing with the long term prognosis of this of this pandemic,\u201d Trudeau said during his daily briefing. \u201cWe will continue to deliver more and more testing kits from around the world, from companies in Canada that are developing them. \u201cWe know there\u2019s a need for more testing kits and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Ontario has faced criticism for its sluggish testing of COVID-19. It continues to have the fewest tests on a per capita basis in Canada \u2014 510 tests for every 100,000 residents. Alberta has done nearly 1,500 tests per 100,000 while B.C. has done 950 tests per 100,000. Alison McGeer, director of the infectious diseases epidemiology research unit at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, said there is no one solution to a problem during a pandemic and Public Health Ontario\u2019s lab system is working around the clock when it comes to testing. In two weeks Ontario was able to clear a backlog of tests from over 10,000 down to just over 300. Canada\u2019s chief medical officer Theresa Tam said Monday that the global supply chains can be \u201cvery difficult\u201d during a pandemic, with countries fighting for the same material, and they are looking for more \u201cmade-in-Canada\u201d solutions \u2014 like the Spartan test. She said with limited resources, jurisdictions are focusing testing on vulnerable communities, health-care workers and small cluster detection. \u201cWe want the supplies to be utilised in the most effective way possible,\u201d she said. \u201cThat does mean testing in situations where you\u2019re most likely to be finding the infection and in the most high risk situations.\u201d Last week, provincial health experts in Ontario say they expect\u00a0COVID-19 could kill 3,000 to 15,000 people in the province over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, of which could last up to two years. As of Monday morning, Canada has tested over 334,000 people with more than 15,800 cases and 290 deaths. Experts who spoke with   say Canada needs to be putting more money towards testing and contact tracing, which involves retracing the steps of a COVID-19 patient and tracking down anyone who may have had contact with them. \u201cGiven that we\u2019ve got this ongoing community spread, we need to be testing aggressively and not just restricting it to those patients who are sick or health-care workers,\u201d said Peter Phillips, a clinical professor specializing in infectious diseases at the University of British Columbia. \u201cIf we don\u2019t know where it is we can\u2019t contain it.\u201d"},

The variant, identified locally as \u201cDelta plus,\u201d was found in 16 cases in the state of Maharashtra, Federal Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan told a news conference. The ministry said Delta plus showed increased transmissibility and advised states to increase testing. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t On Monday, India vaccinated a record 8.6 million people as it began offering free shots to all adults, but experts doubted it could maintain that pace. \u201cThis is clearly not sustainable,\u201d Chandrakant Lahariya, an expert in public policy and health systems, told Reuters. \u201cWith such one-day drives, many states have consumed most of their current vaccine stocks, which will affect the vaccination in days to follow.\u201d With the currently projected vaccine supply for the next few months, the maximum daily achievable rate is 4 to 5 million doses, Lahariya added. The effort has so far covered about 5.5% of the 950 million people eligible, even though India is the world\u2019s largest vaccine producer. A devastating second wave during April and May overwhelmed health services, killing hundreds of thousands. Images of funeral pyres blazing in car parks raised questions over the chaotic vaccine rollout. Since May, vaccinations have averaged fewer than 3 million doses a day, far less than the 10 million health officials say are crucial to protect the millions vulnerable to new surges. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Particularly in the countryside, where two-thirds of a population of 1.4 billion lives and the healthcare system is often overstretched, the drive has faltered, experts say. Maintaining the pace will prove challenging when it comes to injecting younger people in such areas, Delhi-based epidemiologist Rajib Dasgupta said. The capital is also facing difficulties. Authorities in New Delhi said more than 8 million residents had yet to receive a first dose and inoculating all adults there would take more than a year at the current pace. India has been administering AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine, made locally by the Serum Institute of India, and a homegrown shot named Covaxin made by Bharat Biotech. Last week, Serum Institute had said it planned to increase monthly production to around 100 million doses from July. Bharat now estimates it will make 23 million doses a month. On Tuesday, television channel CNBC-TV18 reported that phase-3 data for Covaxin showed an efficacy of 77.8%. India may also soon have a mass rollout of Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine, and the government expects to import vaccines this year from major makers such as Pfizer. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Although new infections in India have dropped to their lowest in more than three months, experts say vaccinations should be stepped up because of the transmissibility of new variants. Over the past 24 hours India reported 42,640 new infections, the lowest since March 23, and 1,167 deaths. Infections now stand at 29.98 million, with a death toll of 389,302, health ministry data showed."},

But David Lefebvre, a vice-president at Restaurants Canada, does think the industry faces challenges and will have to innovate as restaurants gradually reopen. \u201cI have a hard time figuring that everything is permanent with the new situation,\u201d he says. For Sachit and Anish Mehra, brothers who manage East India Company restaurants in   and  , are ready if they need to change their approach. For them, a buffet means breaks between lunch and dinner, small-batch cooking and tightly controlled temperatures and cleaning. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do. That\u2019s what we\u2019re known for,\u201d said Sachit Mehra, who added buffet makes up about 90 per cent of their gross average sales. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t They\u2019ve offered takeout and delivery during the pandemic and say there have been many talks as a family about what the future of dine-in service will look like. \u201cIndia has played a big part in the communal meal. It\u2019s never been about one person, one plate. It\u2019s been about shared plates,\u201d says Anish Mehra. \u201cThe buffet was a natural sort of extension of that when we were growing the business and if we need to go back a step \u2026 we\u2019re ready for that.\u201d  and Manitoba are not allowing buffets as the provinces gradually reopen businesses, and there\u2019s no timeline for their return in Alberta, where restaurants and cafes were allowed to reopen last week at half capacity and with physical distancing. In March, Alberta\u2019s chief medical health officer reported that COVID-19 had spread among doctors who attended a curling bonspiel in   where serving spoons at a buffet had been widely handled. For the   community of Weyburn, a buffet of fried chicken and gravy isn\u2019t just an option for lunch; it\u2019s something worth fighting for. Home to one of the last all-you-can-eat   buffets in the world, the city saw residents, including former premier  , rally to save it  . \u201cWe have every intention of reopening it when the time is right and all approved health and safety measures have been implemented,\u201d reads a statement from Linn Free, chief operations officer with KFC Canada.

{"title": "A look at what could happen without a coronavirus vaccine - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted April 27, 2020 2:38 pm", "body": "Researchers around the globe have been working tirelessly to develop a vaccine to treat the novel   which has caused devastation worldwide. Earlier this month, Prime Minister   said the \u201cbest minds\u201d in Canada and abroad are working to develop treatments for the novel coronavirus, but that the country will not return to \u201cthe normal we had before\u201d until a vaccine has been developed. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Trudeau maintained that until a treatment is developed, Canada is going to \u201chave to be very careful.\u201d Currently, there are more than 70 vaccine trials taking place around the world,  Researchers say they are hopeful that a vaccine can be developed, but that it could be up to two years before it would be available for use. But what happens if researchers are unable to develop a vaccine, or if the virus mutates? Here\u2019s what experts say. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Dr. Jeff Kwong, an infectious disease specialist who teaches at the University of Toronto, previously told Global News if a vaccine isn\u2019t developed, a certain percentage of the population would need to become infected to develop what is known as   in order for the pandemic to end. The idea of herd immunity, Kwong said, is that enough people within a population are immune to a virus because they have already been infected, or they have been vaccinated that there is no one to spread the virus to. He said in this case, in without a vaccine, around half of Canada\u2019s population would need to develop natural immunity virus. \u201cSo operating on the assumption that they do have protection after you\u2019ve had the virus once, it\u2019s probably going to be more than 50 per cent,\u201d he said. But, Kwong said it is unclear at this time how long the immunity lasts, or even if those who have been infected would be protected at all. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anyone knows,\u201d he said. \u201cI think especially because this is a new virus, we don\u2019t know The   has expressed similar concerns, saying on Friday that there is currently \u201cno evidence\u201d to suggest people who have recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies that would protect them from a subsequent infection. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Without a vaccine, Canada is likely to see a number of \u201csubsequent smaller humps\u201d of the novel coronavirus over the next several years, Jason Tetro, a microbiologist and author of  , told Global News. David J. Kelvin, a professor at Dalhouse University\u2019s Department of Microbiology and Immunology, also noted that antivirals may be useful in such a scenario. \u201cThere are several groups working on antivirals,\u201d he told Global News in an email. \u201cI think if we fail at a vaccine, antivirals will become the main source of protection from disease by limiting viral infection or limiting viral growth once we are infected.\u201d Tetro said to suggest things will return to normal after a vaccine is developed is a \u201clofty goal\u201d to set because there is still \u201cno proof\u201d that it would provide full immunity against the virus. He said the difficulty researchers encounter when developing a vaccine for coronaviruses is that the immune response is not always as strong as is seen with other viruses, including measles, mumps or influenza. That means a vaccine for this novel coronavirus may require either a number of booster shots, or several different vaccination steps over the course of a few years, Tetro explained. \u201cThat is the big problem that we\u2019re facing right now \u2014 how good is our immune system going to be after we get the vaccination?\u201d he said. \u201cSo far, it hasn\u2019t been that great Tetro added even if a vaccine is developed, the public should maintain some form of physical distancing and continue to practice proper hygiene. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping is that even though the vaccine does look like it may be coming down the road, we don\u2019t lose what we\u2019ve already learned, because you never know when another one of these strains is going to come out of the wild and into the human population,\u201d he said. Asked if this virus could mutate, and if that would impact vaccine development, Tetro said that is \u201cnot going to happen,\u201d because there \u201cisn\u2019t much mutation going on at all.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWhen you look at how many times this virus has gone through people over the course of the last four months now, you would have expected at least some kind of alteration that would change the way that it looks, the way that flu does he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen that.\u201d If that does happen, Kelvin explained scientists will have to create new vaccines each time it mutates. \u201cSeveral different strategies are being developed, many where the mutation site can be easily changed and the vaccine ramped up in a short period of time similar to sometimes of flu vaccines,\u201d he said. Tetro added if another similar strain of this novel coronavirus emerges, and we have already developed a vaccine then we should have \u201cpartial immunity,\u201d meaning we won\u2019t end up with the same number of severe cases. \u201cIf, however, we have something that is a completely different type of coronavirus but has the ability to cause severe infection, well, then once again, we\u2019re back where we began, where we are essentially being exposed to a virus for the first time for which we have no partial immunity, he said."},

But what about an irregular period? Hundreds of menstruating individuals have flooded social media to report changes in their cycles, which they say happened after taking the COVID-19 vaccine. The most common reports? Heavy flow, spotting, lengthier cycles, or even bleeding during menopause. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a look for sure. I believe what women are saying,\u201d said   scientific director for the Centre for Menstrual Cycle and Ovulation Research (CemCOR), and professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the University of British Columbia. Prior   for CemCOR about these changes, citing what she says is a striking similarity between what menstruating individuals are experiencing after the COVID-19 vaccine, and after being tear-gassed at BLM protests. At the start of April, an associate professor at the University of Illinois   on Twitter. After receiving hundreds of replies from users who also reported similar menstrual changes, she   that apparently garnered 22,000 responses. \u201cIt suggests it\u2019s a real phenomenon, and that we need to understand what\u2019s occurring physiologically,\u201d Prior said. But just because these people\u2019s experiences are real doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re directly caused by the COVID-19 vaccine. \u201cThe normal menstrual cycle is set up weeks before flow. \u2026 In other words, it\u2019s a process. So how could something that happened a day, or two, or three ago, or five \u2014 how could it influence menstrual flow,\u201d said Prior. To prove whether these menstrual changes are directly caused by the COVID-19 vaccine, menstrual flow should be monitored during clinical trials of the drug. But   says that usually never happens with any vaccine. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the answers because it wasn\u2019t studied,  said Bogler, who is the chair of family medicine obstetrics at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital in Toronto, and co-founder of \u201cIt\u2019s somewhat infuriating, I believe, when I feel like I can\u2019t counsel my patients \u2014 women who are menstruating,\u00a0 \u2014 on the full spectrum of potential side effects that could impact them. \u2026 I don\u2019t want my patients surprised if they have spotting, or earlier bleeding, or heavier menses.\u201d But Bogler said this gap in research is not shocking. In fact, it consistently presents itself in numerous issues that affect women \u2014 like how pregnant individuals were left out of the COVID-19 initial vaccine trials. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t As of May 9, 323 menstrual events associated with the COVID-19 vaccine have been reported on the  . It\u2019s important to note that most events on the website are voluntarily reported, which means the real figures might be higher. It\u2019s also critical to highlight that an adverse event reported on VAERS does not mean that the vaccine has been established as the actual cause of that event. Meanwhile, a search of the   on May 9 produced zero results relating to menstrual changes. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Any individual menstrual changes can be triggered by many life events, including weight changes or stress, as well as the changes that occur as a part of a woman\u2019s life,\u201d the statement read. Bogler and Prior have a few theories as to why this could be happening. One possibility, according to Prior, is that these menstrual changes are happening to individuals who believe they ovulate regularly, but actually don\u2019t. This is called a silent ovulatory disturbance. During a typical menstrual cycle, an egg makes its way from the ovary into the uterus every month, and the uterine lining begins to thicken as the body prepares for a baby. If the egg isn\u2019t fertilized, the uterine lining sheds, causing menstrual blood. However, those experiencing silent ovulatory disturbances don\u2019t release an egg into the uterus every month.\u00a0 According to Prior, this means their lining is more fragile, and could be susceptible to irregular spotting or bleeding \u2014 like the one experienced after taking the vaccine. But there\u2019s another possibility. Bogler said the uterus lining is part of the immune system, which means these side effects could be inflammation triggered by a female\u2019s immune response to the vaccine. Both experts maintain that the events are short-lived, do not impact fertility, and are non-life-threatening, but they should be reported to your doctor. Yet even if these changes may not put you in immediate danger, Bogler says it\u2019s still a frustrating and scary ordeal to many women and menstruating individuals, who don\u2019t have science behind them to make them feel secure about their experiences. As for whether you should be worried about the vaccine, Bogler says the safest option is to get it. \u201cEveryone should be receiving the vaccine as their first shield against COVID-19,\u201d Bogler said."},

The 15-year-old says she struggled with bulimia before the pandemic, but the lockdown made it worse. \u201cIt was very hard in the beginning, especially because school gave me structure throughout the day, and it just helped me be more confident,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re alone and isolated then it\u2019s harder to figure out your feelings, figure out your emotions.\u201d She sought help from her family doctor and a therapist, but it gave her more anxiety. Dancing helped, but classes were cancelled twice due to the lockdowns. \u201cWhen I dance, when I go to the studio, that\u2019s a place where I can leave everything else, like all my stresses, behind,\u201d Ceilidh says. Talking to her parents about her issues helps, she says. \u201cShe\u2019s fought hard to adapt, and she\u2019s adapted as well as you could, but it\u2019s very difficult for everyone when everything comes to a crushing halt,\u201d says her father, Mike Chopowick. Ceilidh is not alone. Researchers say the pandemic has had a profound effect on the mental health of children. Dr. Daphne Korczak, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Toronto\u2019s Hospital for Sick Children, says they launched a study in April to examine the effects of the pandemic on young people\u2019s mental health. They\u2019ve surveyed more than 1,000 parents and 350 children during the first lockdown last spring and continue to monitor them. \u201cWe found that roughly 70 per cent of children experienced deterioration of their mental health,\u201d Korczak says. \u201cA significant proportion of kids have experienced increased depression, anxiety, irritability, and they\u2019re just less able to buffer the day-to-day frustration, compared to their pre-pandemic self.\u201d Children cry more often and more easily, she says, they are less able to tolerate disappointment, less motivated to get involved in activities, are restless, bored and have a sense of loneliness and hopelessness. Eating disorders are also up. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that kids are not all right right now,\u201d Korczak says. The biggest predictor of mental health problems the researchers found was the degree of social isolation children experience, she says. \u201cHere we are in the second lockdown and children are without in-person school, without sports or activities and the ability to get together with their friends,\u201d she says. A larger proportion of children with previous mental health problems are struggling since the pandemic began, she says, and 40 per cent of children with no previous mental health issues have experienced deterioration of their mental health. Even more worrisome, she says, the problems persisted after students went back to school in the fall. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a decrease in mental health symptoms from the first lockdown and that makes them less resilient coming into the second lockdown,\u201d Korczak says. School looked drastically different in the fall. Everyone wore masks, temperatures and symptoms were checked. Many extracurricular activities and sports were cancelled. High school students in COVID-19 hot spots saw their in-person time significantly reduced and many boards implemented a cohort system that kept student groups from mixing. Elementary students were limited to strict classroom cohorts, even in the schoolyard. Games like tag were forbidden. \u201cSchool wasn\u2019t great,\u201d Ceilidh says. \u201cI only saw some friends for five minutes and others not at all if they were in a different cohort.\u201d The Hospital for Sick Children has been a proponent for returning kids to in-person school for a variety of reasons, including mental health benefits. \u201cOne of the biggest concerns that I\u2019m hearing are parents (who) say this is changing who my child is, my child used to be a child who was very social and happy and eager to learn and now my child is timid and nervous when they come across new people and isn\u2019t motivated to participate in school,\u201d Korczak says. \u201cWe need to prioritize kids and we need to prioritize their mental health.\u201d Ruaraidh Butler, the founder of Your Life Counts, an organization devoted to helping the mental health of young people, says demand for their services has never been higher. Over the two decades since he launched the organization, Butler says his job, in its simplest terms, is about restoring hope. With no end to the pandemic in sight, many youth have told him they\u2019ve lost hope. They fear the virus, they fear death, their entire lives have been transformed and a belief has settled in after a year that life will be forever changed. So Butler dug into the past for a history lesson to tell the youth he helps: the First World War, which lasted from 1914 to 1918, and the Spanish Flu pandemic, which began in 1918 and lasted for several years. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going through right now is historic, it is brutal, it is horrible,\u201d Butler says. \u201cBut guess what? It has been here before and if you look back, you\u2019ll see that we got through it.\u201d That lesson has helped many youth restore some hope in their lives, he says. \u201cHope has to find its place in our lives and in our hearts,\u201d Butler says. \u201cHope means different things to different people, but I think at its core, it is that sense of optimism, that sense that things suck right now, but it\u2019s going to get better.\u201d"},

Although we\u2019ve rapidly accepted epidemiology-based news, the public hasn\u2019t been given the chance to fully absorb what all these terms really mean.

Of course, factors such as the type of test, whether the individual had symptoms before being tested and the timing of the test can also impact how well the test predicts whether someone is infected.  for understanding the results of COVID-19 tests. In the epidemiological context, sensitivity is the proportion of true positives that are correctly identified. If 100 people have a disease, and the test identifies 90 of these people as having the disease, the sensitivity of the test is 90 per cent. Specificity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those without the disease. If 100 people don\u2019t have the disease, and the test correctly identifies 90 people as disease-free, the test has a specificity of 90 per cent. This simple table helps outline how sensitivity and specificity are calculated when the prevalence \u2014 the percentage of the population that actually has the disease \u2014 is 25 per cent (totals in bold): A test sensitivity of 80 per cent can seem great for a newly released test (like for the made-up case numbers I reported above). But these numbers don\u2019t convey the whole message. The usefulness of a test in a population is not determined by its sensitivity and specificity. When we use sensitivity and specificity, we are figuring out how well a test works when we already know which people do, and don\u2019t, have the disease. But the true value of a test in a real-world setting comes from its ability to correctly predict who is infected and who is not. This makes sense because in a real-world setting, we don\u2019t know who truly has the disease \u2014 we rely on the test itself to tell us. We use the positive predictive value and negative predictive value of a test to summarize that test\u2019s predictive ability. To drive the point home, think about this: in a population in which no one has the disease, even a test that is terrible at detecting anyone with the disease will appear to work great. It will \u201ccorrectly\u201d identify most people as not having the disease. This has more to do with how many people have the disease in a population (prevalence) rather than how well the test works. Using the same numbers as above, we can estimate the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), but this time we focus on the row totals (in bold). The PPV is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the total number of people identified as positive by the test. The PPV is interpreted as the probability that someone that has tested positive actually has the disease. The NPV is the probability that someone that tested negative does not have the disease. Although sensitivity and specificity do not change as the proportion of diseased individuals changes in a population, the PPV and NPV are heavily dependent on the prevalence. Let\u2019s see what happens when we redraw our disease table when the population prevalence sits at one per cent instead of 25 per cent (much closer to the true prevalence of COVID-19 in Canada). So, when the disease has low prevalence, the PPV of the test can be very low. This means that the probability that someone that tested positive actually has COVID-19 is low. Of course, depending on the sensitivity, specificity and the prevalence in the population, the reverse can be true as well: someone that tested negative might not truly be disease-free. What does this mean as mass testing begins for COVID-19? At the very least it means the public should have clear information about the implications of false positives. All individuals should be aware of  , especially as we move to a   to inform our actions and decisions. As we can see using some simple tables and math above, the PPV and NPV can be limiting even in the face of a \u201cgood\u201d test with high sensitivity and specificity."},

{"title": "Coronavirus: When will a COVID-19 vaccine be ready?  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted March 12, 2020 12:46 pm", "body": "Medical teams and researchers around the world are racing to develop a vaccine for   which has sickened more than 127,000, but health experts say a novel coronavirus vaccine is still 12 to 24 months away. David Kelvin, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Dalhousie University, just received a $1-million grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to help examine the outbreak, specifically relating to his work on evaluating patients diagnosed with the virus. He said a realistic target for a vaccine would be in the 18-month range. The WHO has also said a vaccine is at least 18 months away. \u201cIt might happen sooner but I think that\u2019s unrealistic,\u201d Kelvin told Global News. \u201c18 months to two years would be really fantastic if we achieved that target.\u201d Kelvin said vaccines traditionally take years to develop, but there\u2019s been one advantage with COVID-19 \u2014 the structure and genome of the virus is very similar to the SARS coronavirus. This has allowed scientists to draw on the research from early SARS vaccine candidates. Kelvin\u2019s said his colleague, Chris Richardson, is currently working on a vaccine that places a SARS protein inside the measles vaccine. Testing is now underway at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization \u2013 International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan. \u201cThe first phase of testing is in animal models and those models allow us to determine whether or not that vaccine allows for protection against infection with COVID 19,\u201d he said. Steven Hoffman, the director of the Global Strategy Lab and a professor of global health, law and political science at\u00a0York University, said the best estimates indicate a vaccine is still another year away from being fully deployed. Canada should be preparing for a scenario where there is no vaccine in the short or medium term, he said, noting that in 17 years a vaccine for SARS was never fully developed. \u201cThere\u2019s extraordinary resources, scientific attention and focus on trying to get a vaccine for this strain of coronavirus,\u201d said Steven Hoffman. \u201cWe should be doing everything we can to give science the best chance it has at developing something as quickly as possible.\u201d Canada has at least   of COVID-19, and now   is self-isolating after his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, developed flu-like symptoms and got tested for the new coronavirus. In order for a vaccine to be used widely, it needs to do two things, according to Kelvin. First, it has to create an \u201cimmune response\u201d where the body produces antibodies that can fight against the specific virus. And, second, it has to be safe for the person receiving the vaccine, preventing them from being sick rather than harming them in some way. \u201cWhen the virus infects you, what happens is you go through the initial stages of not feeling well, fever, and then some people develop pneumonia. If you recover, what happens is your immune system is now creating a response to the virus,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cEverybody who survives from the virus has a built-in memory later on. \u201cThe vaccine creates the memory situation without being sick.\u201d Around the world, roughly 20 coronavirus vaccine candidates are being developed by research institutes and drugmakers including America\u2019s Johnson & Johnson and France\u2019s Sanofi SA. In China, more than 80 clinical trials are underway according to the World Health Organization as medical researchers work to evaluate everything from HIV drugs to stem cells and even traditional medicines to treat COVID-19. Two pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. are getting close to human testing. Biotechnology company Moderna Inc \u2014 working with the U.S.-funded National Institutes of Health (NIH) \u2014 has announced plans to start a trial of a vaccine candidate on 45 people in Seattle this month. Testing on animals will proceed simultaneously with human trials, the NIH told Reuters. Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., an immunotherapy company, is working with a company in China to develop a vaccine and expects to start human clinical trials in 30 U.S. volunteers in April. However, some experts are concerned that accelerated testing doesn\u2019t adequately evaluate harm to humans. Some studies have shown that coronavirus vaccines carry the risk of what is known as \u201cvaccine enhancement\u201d where it could end up worsening the infection in some patients rather than preventing it. There are some people who believe that if you had created a vaccine that was really similar to a previous vaccine that went through the system, then you could eliminate those initial steps,\u201d said Kelvin. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the wisest route to go.\u201d"},

However, despite the end of the order, the so-called emergency brake (similar to the grey lockdown restrictions under Ontario\u2019s old colour-coded COVID-19 response framework) imposed on a variety of sectors, including businesses, will remain in place until the province moves into the first phase of the reopening plan, which is on track to happen in mid-June. It was on April 8 when another stay-at-home order and an emergency declaration was imposed across the province. At the time, officials said the orders were needed to combat rising COVID-19 cases, and curb the increased spread of variants of concern cases as well as strained intensive care unit capacity. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The main reasons for leaving one\u2019s home include shopping at a pharmacy or for groceries, attending health-care services or appointments (including COVID-19 vaccines), going for outdoor exercise, walking pets, going to work if a job can\u2019t be done remotely, or attending child care or school. Also as part of the orders, the government moved to limit most non-essential retail businesses to curbside pickup only. Big-box stores were restricted to selling essential items only for people shopping in-person and capacity caps were imposed. More than a week later, officials unveiled additional measures, including increased police powers (which were partially walked back after public outcry), provincial border checkpoints, and outdoor gathering restrictions. As COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations began to decline in May, many health experts and other stakeholders called on the government to ease restrictions governing outdoor amenities. On May 22, golf courses, tennis courts and other facilities reopened. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In mid-May, the Ontario government revealed its three-phase reopening plan for the entire province. Phase one (primarily allowing retails and reopening more outdoor settings with restrictions) will begin as soon as 60 per cent of all eligible Ontario residents have received their first COVID-19 vaccine doses. The vaccines currently used in Ontario ultimately require two doses. As of May 31, Health Minister Christine Elliott said around 67 per cent of Ontario residents have received their first dose. However, she said hospitalizations, the number of people in ICUs and public health capacity will all be factored in the decision-making process later in June. \u201cThere are a variety of factors that need to be considered, but we are certainly looking at June 14 as being the date when we can move into stage one,\u201d Elliott told reporters on May 31, reiterating a previously issued timeframe. Here's the chart that outlines what's allowed to operate at each phase.  \u2014 Nick Westoll (@NWestoll)  A minimum of three weeks will need to pass and 70 per cent of all eligible Ontario residents will need to have their first COVID-19 vaccine dose and 20 per cent of residents will need to have the required two doses before moving into phase two (reopening more indoor settings on a smaller basis and expanding outdoor settings). After another three-week-minimum period, along with up to 80 per cent of residents receiving their first vaccine dose and 25 per cent receiving their second dose, more indoor activities will be allowed to reopen in phase three where masks can\u2019t always be worn. At the end of each phase, health system indicators will be reviewed before moving to the next step. Officials haven\u2019t publicly indicated what will happen if there is a surge in cases, hospitalizations and/or deaths, but all have encouraged everyone eligible to get a vaccine to do so. In the short-term, not much will change until the first phase of the provincial reopening plan comes into effect. Ontario businesses, amenities and other facilities currently closed will continue to remain shuttered until that time. However,   imposing checks at the Quebec and Manitoba borders, certain enforcement powers and other measures will remain in place until June 16. A spokesperson for Ontario Solicitor General Sylvia Jones added some or all of those regulations could be \u201cextended in 14-day increments.\u201d Dr. David Williams, Ontario\u2019s chief medical officer of health, encouraged people to continue following public health measures. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cStay the task. Our numbers are coming down really well as people are getting their vaccine \u2014 first dose and second dose \u2014 and allowing the immune system to pick up in those three weeks after your dose, but you still have to use the measures of protection at this time.\u201d Meanwhile, when it comes to schools in Ontario, Premier Doug Ford continued to mull whether the facilities will open for in-class learning for the last few weeks of the academic year.

Phase 2B includes more than 945,000 Albertans with underlying health conditions, including cancer patients, transplant recipients, people living with disabilities, dementia and other conditions that put them at a higher risk of severe outcomes of COVID-19.  \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Beginning on Tuesday, March 30, Albertans born in 1963 or earlier with eligible underlying medical conditions will be able to book a vaccine appointment through participating pharmacies that have supply in Calgary, Edmonton and Red Deer. Appointments for this group can be booked directly through  . Alberta Health said in the coming week, more vaccine supply will become available and more pharmacies will begin to offer appointments. Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health asked people for patience as the province moves into the next phase of vaccination. \u201cWith nearly one million Albertans in Phase 2B, this is the largest single group we have made eligible for vaccination,\u201d Dr. Deena Hinshaw said. \u201cWith limited supply, we will have to move slowly and take small steps until more doses arrive.\u201d Alberta Health Services originally said that on April 5 it will start taking bookings for eligible Albertans in Phase 2B who were born in or before 1959. However, AHS later said the age group for those eligible to book starting April 5 was those born in 1963 or earlier. These appointments can be booked through 811 or through the AHS online booking portal. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Additional birth years will be added as more vaccines arrive in the province, Alberta Health said in a media release. \u201cThis is great news for vulnerable Albertans and another big step forward in our vaccine rollout,\u201d Health Minister Tyler Shandro said in a media release. \u201cAnyone with these serious health conditions will now be eligible for vaccines that give effective protection from COVID-19. We\u2019re ramping up our vaccinations as fast as the incoming vaccine supply allows. Every adult in Alberta will be offered a first dose by the end of June.\u201d Alberta Health said by April 23, all Albertans born in 2005 or earlier with eligible underlying health conditions will be able to book a vaccine appointment through a pharmacy or AHS. Phase 2B applies to all Albertans born in 2005 or earlier with any of the following conditions: For more specific details on the eligible conditions,  . Alberta Health said people in Phase 2B will not be required to provide proof of their condition, however, they may want to speak with their doctor or pharmacist to determine if their condition is on the list. \u201cI know many, many Albertans will benefit from vaccination, including those with other medical conditions, but I urge people to wait their turn and ensure those at the highest risk receive protection first,\u201d Hinshaw stressed. Starting Monday, AHS will offer COVID-19 vaccines to about 3,000 housebound Albertans who are eligible in phases 1 and 2A. Alberta Health said the program, which aims to ensure those physically unable to leave their homes get vaccinated as quickly as possible, will expand to people in Phase 2B in the coming days. Alberta Health said the COVID-19 vaccine will be administered by AHS public health or home care, similar to how the annual influenza vaccine is provided to homebound Albertans. AHS said its teams are reaching out to eligible home care clients directly and that people do not need to make appointments. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Anyone who was eligible for vaccine in phases 1 and 2A who have not yet booked an appointment can still do so. As of Monday afternoon, more than 608,000 doses of vaccine have been administered in Alberta. Until more people are able to be vaccinated, Hinshaw once again stressed the importance of following the public health measures that are in place. \u201cTwice we have bent the curve before by limiting in-person interactions and by protecting each other in our communities. And we can do it again.\u201d This week, Canada is expected to receive its largest shipment of COVID-19 vaccine to date, with around 3.3 million shots due for delivery from different pharmaceutical companies over the coming days. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Also Monday,   vaccine to those 55 and under.

Saskatchewan is   in Phase 2 of its COVID-19 vaccination plan meaning they are starting to work their way through vaccinating the general population, ages 69 years old and under. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Effective May 20, those aged 12 and older are eligible to book a vaccine over the phone or via the online booking system. The link to the online booking system can be found on the  . To book an appointment over the phone, eligible residents can call 1-833-SASK-VAX (1-833-727-5829). On April 13, the Saskatchewan government updated eligibility to include a number of groups for vaccine prioritization. Officials announced that those aged 16 and 17 who are considered clinically extremely vulnerable and pregnant women are included in priority vaccination. Individuals who fall into either of those categories will receive an eligibility letter from their physician and will need to book over the phone. Officials also announced that\u00a0front-line health-care\u00a0workers not included in Phase 1 prioritization will be allocated 13,152 first doses that are left over from priority\u00a0health-care\u00a0workers. In Phase 1, 40,500\u00a0health-care\u00a0workers were prioritized for the vaccine. Of those,\u00a0first-dose uptake\u00a0has been 27,348,\u00a0or 67 per cent. Officials said all physicians are being included in priority sequencing as they may need to assist in clinical care areas and surge capacity needs. Eligible SHA\u00a0health-care\u00a0workers and physicians will receive notice and a letter of eligibility from either the College of Physicians and Surgeons for doctors or the SHA for other\u00a0health-care\u00a0staff. The SHA\u00a0front-line health-care\u00a0staff includes outpatient and community services staff nurses, pharmacists, therapy staff, mental health professionals, social workers, housekeeping, dietary and ward support staff. Health officials will also focus on vaccinating first responders including police officers, fire fighters and public health inspectors through mobile vaccination units once current priority populations are complete. These vaccines will be dispatched to central workplace settings. In a press release, the SHA said that targeted vaccination of first responders will occur once congregate living setting vaccinations are complete. Government officials said that once residents become eligible they will remain eligible even as the government expands vaccine accessibility to other groups. That means if they don\u2019t get the vaccine right away, they won\u2019t miss their chance. On April 20, an SHA press release stated that additional front-line workers would be prioritized for the COVID-19 vaccine once age eligibility drops to 40, which is slated to happen on the morning of April 30. Another press release sent on April 29 said effective April 30 at 8 a.m. eligibility for the COVID-19 vaccine would be extended to police officers, firefighters, volunteer firefighters, correctional staff, border security officers, public health inspectors, teachers and educational staff working with students, daycare staff at facilities attached to schools, and front-line healthcare workers with direct patient contact employed by the SHA or private employers, including dentists, chiropractors and optometrists. \u201cIf you\u2019re in Phase 1\u00a0and\u00a0for\u00a0some\u00a0reason\u00a0you\u00a0haven\u2019t\u00a0booked\u00a0yet,\u00a0please\u00a0keep\u00a0in\u00a0mind\u00a0that\u00a0once\u00a0you\u00a0are\u00a0eligible,\u00a0you\u00a0are\u00a0always\u00a0eligible,\u201d SHA CEO Scott Livingstone said at a March 18 press conference. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t A list of clinically extremely vulnerable conditions can be found on a   on the SHA website. The SHA has identified about 25,000 Saskatchewan residents in this category. Livingstone explained that clinically extremely vulnerable individuals will need to book their appointments over the phone as the online booking system is strictly age-based and will not allow those under the eligible age to book an appointment. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Saskatchewan launched Phase 2 of their vaccination plan earlier than anticipated as they saw about 80 per cent uptake in each age category booking immunization appointments. At a press conference on Thursday, Minister of Health Paul Merriman explained that there were open appointments which is why the government expanded eligibility. \u201cWe want to keep the vaccine lines full. We want to keep the appointments full so we can get through this again as fast as we possibly can,\u201d Merriman said. , Premier Scott Moe said the government would be stretching out the time between first and second doses of vaccine to a maximum of four months. This is based on the recommendation of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization, also known as NACI. This has allowed the government to vaccinate the majority of age groups sooner. Global News reviewed vaccination documents and press conferences and found the following: The number of people vaccinated daily in Saskatchewan is dependent on vaccine supply. Mass vaccination sites are expected to be open by April. These clinics will accommodate a maximum of 30 immunization tables. Each table will be able to deliver six to seven vaccines per hour. An additional 19 vaccine doses will be delivered per hour at the clinic\u2019s drive-thru site. A total of 230 sites will be open across Saskatchewan including 149 mass clinics, as well as 58 mobile and 23 drive-thru clinics. Clinic locations and hours of operations will be made public once the province moves into Phase 2, which could be as early as April. The tentative hours of operations for mass immunization and drive-thru clinics in Regina and Saskatoon is seven days a week, 16 hours per day. As for clinics in other regions in Saskatchewan, tentative hours are Monday to Friday, 12 hours a day, and Saturday to Sunday, eight hours a day. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In addition to mass clinics and mobile and drive-thru sites, the province has also made an agreement with the Pharmacy Association of Saskatchewan to follow the flu immunization model to deliver the COVID-19 vaccine. On April 12, the government announced pharmacists would start administering\u00a0vaccines the\u00a0week of April 26, or\u00a0earlier,\u00a0depending on vaccine supply. Pharmacists will also be offering vaccines to pharmacy and grocery staff working in the building where vaccines are offered. The number of people vaccinated per day is dependent on supply. Moe has been vocal with his criticism of the federal government\u2019s procurement of vaccines. At the virtual premiers conference on March 4, Moe said the federal government has done a \u201cdisappointing job at best,\u201d of procuring vaccines. Saskatchewan\u2019s chief medical health officer, Dr. Saqib Shahab, has said with the approvals of more vaccines such as AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, individuals aged 18 and over could be vaccinated with a first dose by June. On March 9, Moe announced that people in their 60s will begin getting their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine starting April 5. People in their 50s will start getting vaccinated on April 19, people in their 40s will begin vaccinations May 10, people in their 30s on May 31 and all other adults should start getting vaccinated by June 14. On the same day, Moe said more doses are coming in the next three weeks than the province received in the past three months. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t According to the federal government\u2019s   of vaccines, Saskatchewan should see 658,710 Pfizer vaccines delivered between April 26 and July 4. This number is based on a six-dose per vial product. A total of 49,800 Moderna doses will be allocated to Saskatchewan between April 26 and May 16. On March 26, the SHA  that a shipment of 21,300 Moderna vaccines would be delayed up to six days and cause some already booked appointments to be impacted. From March 8-14, Saskatchewan received 15,500 AstraZeneca vaccines. Between March 29 and April 4, Saskatchewan received 46,600 AstraZeneca doses from the   An additional 9,800 AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines arrived from   between April 5 and 11. On March 29, Saskatchewan announced they would   on administering the COVID-19 AstraZeneca vaccine to anyone under the age of 55, following updated guidelines from NACI. Saskatchewan opened up a drive-thru clinic for Regina residents aged 60-64 and priority health-care workers to get AstraZeneca vaccinations due to high case numbers in the city. The clinic was\u00a0 operational for nine days and was available for residents age 58 and over. The province opened up the age eligibility based on national guidelines that those over 65 can receive an AstraZeneca vaccine. The clinic reopened on April 3, along with drive-thru and walk-in clinics in other communities across the province. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The vaccinations were offered on a first-come, first-served basis. The site closed temporarily on March 22 because vaccines had run out. The SHA said the drive-thru will remain closed until more vaccine comes available. Saskatchewan prioritized long-term and personal care home residents in Phase 1, followed by residents over the age of 70 in all communities, as well as residents aged 50 and over in rural, remote northern communities. Phase 1 also accommodates health-care workers in emergency departments; intensive care units; COVID-19 wards; COVID testing and assessment staff; respiratory therapists; code blue and trauma teams; and EMS, road and air transport teams. In Phase 2, the general population will be vaccinated in 10-year increments starting with those in their 60s. Along with this age group, those living in emergency shelters and group homes, and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be vaccinated at the same time. There is also the potential for age groupings to widen for those under 50 if vaccine supplies allow. According to government and health officials, vaccinating by age group is \u201cthe most rapid and efficient way\u201d to deliver vaccinations. \u201cIn contrast, vaccination targeted to specific conditions or populations is much more complex and significantly slows down the ability to reach all residents as quickly as possible. This approach also carries the added risk of potentially missing some vulnerable groups,\u201d the government explained in their vaccine rollout plan. The province has rolled out a vaccine campaign on print, TV, radio, digital, social media and billboards. The campaign will focus on providing accurate and timely information to the public, as well as spread awareness about the COVID-19 vaccine. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t An online booking system has been developed by the Government of Saskatchewan and will allow residents to book their first and second doses appointments. The system launched on March 11 at 8 a.m. The system was first open for seniors aged 85 and over who wanted to book an appointment online or over the phone. As of May 20, those aged 12 and older are eligible to book a vaccine over the phone or via the online booking system. Individuals aged 18 to 26 living in the province\u2019s Northern Administrative District can call to book their COVID-19 vaccine.   can be found on the government\u2019s website. Family members and friends who are not eligible can book on behalf of someone who is eligible. The online booking system can be accessed on the  . Residents wishing to call instead can speak to a booking agent by dialing 1-833-SASK-VAX (1-833-727-5829). The call centre operates from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. seven days a week. To book an appointment using the online system, residents should have their valid health card and cell phone number or email address handy. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Over the next few days, the government will open up this booking system to other age groups. The Saskatchewan Health Authority originally had been calling eligible individuals to book appointments. They phased this process out once the online booking system was operational. The online booking system will also incorporate an algorithm allowing individuals to also book their second dose, SHA CEO Scott Livingstone said. Health officials announced on May 6 that health-care workers will soon start administering second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The beginning of the\u00a0second-dose\u00a0administrations will overlap with the completion of the first\u00a0dose, which health officials anticipate everyone\u00a0over the age of 18 will have access to by the end of May. As of May 7, 45,655 people have received both vaccine doses in Saskatchewan. Starting on May 17, anyone\u00a0aged\u00a085 or older,\u00a0or anyone who received their first dose before Feb. 15,\u00a0will have the opportunity to book their second dose. Provincial officials added that second doses will be given out according to the age-based and priority sequencing of first doses. The interval between the first and second doses can be up to 16 weeks. Saskatchewan will start second doses at an interval of 13 weeks or sooner based on the availability of vaccines. On May 6, Saskatchewan government officials also announced\u00a0children\u00a012 to 15 years\u00a0old\u00a0would be included in the vaccine rollout. Health Canada authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for the age category on May 5. Previous to this, the vaccine was only approved for Canadians over the age of 16. Officials are aiming to have the shot available to those between the ages of 12 and 15 by May 20. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The province is looking to have first doses administered in school-based programs before the end of the school year. Youth can also visit other clinics to get vaccinated as well. Officials added that parental consent will be required for youth to receive the vaccine. As of May 6, details on the school-based programs were still being finalized. The province said more information will come from public health and school divisions when available. Youth aged 12 to 15 who are considered clinically extremely vulnerable are immediately eligible to receive the Pfizer vaccine. A letter will need to be presented at the time of immunization. Youth receiving\u00a0Rituximab and Ocrelizumab\u00a0will need to obtain a letter from their physician, who have been provided with a template for this use. Youth with a cancer diagnosis or in treatment or who have received a solid organ transplant will receive the eligibility letter from the Saskatchewan government.\u00a0 While the province hasn\u2019t confirmed if they will be able to meet the federal government\u2019s target, Livingstone said people won\u2019t have to wait up to four months to get their second dose if there\u2019s increasing supply. He added that officials are optimistic about the number of vaccines scheduled to arrive in the future. \u201cThose second doses I don\u2019t think are going to be a challenge at all,\u201d Livingstone said. In a press release sent May 6, officials said it is anticipated that all Saskatchewan residents will have received both vaccine doses by July 31"},

Should they also be signing up to get the vaccine when they\u2019re eligible or does their prior infection offer enough natural immunity? \u201cThere\u2019s no reason   to have a vaccination after you\u2019ve been exposed and caught COVID-19,\u201d said Dave Evans, a professor in the department of medical microbiology and immunology at the University of Alberta. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Alberta Health also encourages everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated, including if you\u2019ve been infected with COVID-19. The provincial health authority says there is no mandatory waiting period between having COVID-19 and being immunized. The recommendation is to wait until you\u2019re no longer infectious and have recovered. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t While natural immunity may offer some protection from reinfection, Evans says the variants of concern complicate things. \u201cSome of these variants\u2026 clearly can reinfect people who\u2019ve already had COVID,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rely on having had the disease to protect you, especially if there are these new variants floating around. \u201cThe ideal thing is to go and get a vaccination as soon as you can.\u201d Plus, the more people in the population who have immunity, the better, he explains. \u201cVaccines aren\u2019t perfect.

{"title": "More young people in Ontario are getting COVID-19. Why is this happening?  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted June 17, 2020 2:12 pm", "body": "New cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel  , are increasing in youths under the age of 20 in Ontario, according to new research from the University of Guelph. The  comes as Ontario public health units have reported increases in cases for those in their 20s compared to older people in Toronto, Hamilton, York Region and Peel Region \u2014 which have been delayed in entering Stage 2 due to its caseload. But it\u2019s not exactly clear why cases have been increasing for young people in these regions, making it difficult to know how to target the problem, experts told Global News. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The research, which has not been published yet in a peer-reviewed journal, examined data from Ontario public health units and found that while cases were declining for other age groups as of mid-May, they were on the rise in young people within regions that carry the brunt of the province\u2019s infections. This increase for the under 20 age bracket isn\u2019t surprising as schools and daycares have been closed in the province, and young people likely want to see their friends, said Ed McBean, the lead researcher of the study and a professor of engineering at the university. \u201cNow we\u2019re entering the summer period where it\u2019s really nice to be outside, and the potential is for the whole scenario of welcoming friends, that\u2019s probably what it is, but we don\u2019t know with absolute certainty,\u201d McBean said on   on June 16. It\u2019s unusual for children to have worse health outcomes if they are infected with COVID-19, but the worry comes if they bring the illness home to their families, said McBean. The rest of Ontario outside of the densely-populated Greater Toronto Area have flattened the curve and are not seeing these same issues, he added. These regions have more opportunities for social engagements for young people, he said. Provincial data this week showed that almost half of Ontario\u2019s new cases announced on June 15 were in Toronto, and nearly a quarter was in the Peel region, representing part of Toronto\u2019s suburbs. Findings from the study also showed that in Peel region, cases for people under 20 rose from two per day in mid-April to around nine per day by the end of May. During that same period in Toronto, cases rose from four per day to more than 10 in that age bracket. McBean\u2019s advice to young people in these regions is to be extra vigilant, to continue to distance and wash hands and keep in mind more vulnerable people will be facing the consequences for the actions of those under 30. \u201cOnce we can flatten this curve and keep it down, we do not want resurgence and to have to go into another lockdown as a consequence,\u201d he said. New COVID-19 cases in heavily populated regions in Ontario are also seeing a spike in cases for people in their 20s. In Hamilton as of June 17,  in the last 10 days are individuals in their 20s. Overall, people in that age bracket make up 20 per cent of the city\u2019s cases, which is higher than any other demographic. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In the Peel region, that age demographic makes up   In comparison, 6.5 per cent of that region\u2019s cases are ages 70-79 and 11.4 per cent are 60-69. Young people tend to pay less attention to their health and are less likely to perceive that they may have some symptoms, and are more likely to want to engage in social activities following lockdown \u2014 which could be one theory for the increase, said Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease specialist and associate professor at the University of Alberta. This is not to suggest that all young people are spending time indoors together, but they may be engaging in more practices that break social distancing compared to other groups, she said. \u201cIt might just be a pattern of behaviour that is slightly riskier, but enough to promote the spread of infection,\u201d said Saxinger. The reopening of the province may have prompted some to believe they can behave like \u201cnormal\u201d, even when the Greater Toronto Area continues to be the source of the majority of Ontario\u2019s cases, she said. Communicating the nuance of the reopening to young people is difficult, and without that clear messaging, teens and 20-somethings may not be assessing their own risks accurately when they socialize, she added. \u201c(The increase) is probably related to just a slight general increase in riskier activities in a group that is not as good at evaluating their own risk,\u201d she said. Saxinger says a solution could be more targeted messaging from the Ontario government that is more likely to stick with young people, even through social media where it could resonate more Dr. Gerald Evans, the chair of the infectious disease department at Queen\u2019s University, also agrees that the rise in cases comes down to young people wanting to see others following months in isolation. \u201cAs they\u2019ve seen from their perspective the relaxing of some of these social distancing measures, they\u2019ve quickly gone back to what they\u2019ve experienced was normal socialization for someone their age,\u201d said Evans. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Young people tend to socialize in larger groups and often indoors, he said. Those are both factors that would create larger transmission rates, he added. As well, because infections in older people have decreased, it may make the younger demographic\u2019s case counts appear more starkly higher, he said. Gathering in parks in large crowds \u2014 like the infamous congregating of young people at   at the end of May \u2014 appears problematic, but the risk of transmission reduces significantly when individuals are outdoors, said Evans. But he says he wonders how many people from the park on that day actually got tested. Earlier in June, Toronto\u2019s medical officer of health, Eileen de Villa, said the city   in COVID-19 cases from that day. \u201cThat\u2019s because there are air currents with the wind blowing even on a calm day. When that happens you\u2019re going to get less transmission,\u201d he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t He also echoes Saxinger in that young people may be less perceptive if they have symptoms and are possibly less likely to get tested, and may continue to socialize even when mildly sick. Through his research on sexually transmitted infections, Evans says it\u2019s understood young people are more likely to ignore their symptoms, and not get tested. Ontario does not provide the demographics of those tested in their daily epidemiologic summaries. For young people overall, he recommends if you are going to socialize, to do it outside. \u201cThat\u2019s at least one effective step in reducing transmission,\u201d he said. \u00a0can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing \u2014 very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms,\u00a0 . To\u00a0 , experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out. In situations where you can\u2019t keep a safe distance from others, public health officials recommend the use of a non-medical face mask or covering to prevent spreading the respiratory droplets that can carry the virus.

{"title": "\u2018When will it end?\u2019: New data suggests COVID-19 could become endemic - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted March 3, 2021 4:57 pm", "body": "Chris Murray, a University of Washington disease expert whose projections on   infections and deaths are closely followed worldwide, is changing his assumptions about the course of the pandemic. Murray had until recently been hopeful that the discovery of several effective vaccines could help countries achieve herd immunity, or nearly eliminate transmission through a combination of inoculation and previous infection. But in the last month, data from a vaccine trial in South Africa showed not only that a rapidly-spreading coronavirus variant could dampen the effect of the vaccine, it could also evade natural immunity in people who had been previously infected. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep\u201d after seeing the data, Murray, director of the Seattle-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told Reuters. \u201cWhen will it end?\u201d he asked himself, referring to the pandemic. He is currently updating his model to account for variants\u2019 ability to escape natural immunity and expects to provide new projections as early as this week. A new consensus is emerging among scientists, according to Reuters interviews with 18 specialists who closely track the pandemic or are working to curb its impact. Many described how the breakthrough late last year of two vaccines with around 95% efficacy against COVID-19 had initially sparked hope that the virus could be largely contained, similar to the way measles has been. But, they say, data in recent weeks on new variants from South Africa and Brazil has undercut that optimism. They now believe that SARS-CoV-2 will not only remain with us as an endemic virus, continuing to circulate in communities, but will likely cause a significant burden of illness and death for years to come. As a result, the scientists said, people could expect to continue to take measures such as routine mask-wearing and avoiding crowded places during COVID-19 surges, especially for people at high risk. Even after vaccination, \u201cI still would want to wear a mask if there was a variant out there,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to U.S. President Joe Biden, said in an interview. \u201cAll you need is one little flick of a variant (sparking) another surge, and there goes your prediction\u201d about when life gets back to normal. Some scientists, including Murray, acknowledge that the outlook could improve. The new vaccines, which have been developed at record speed, still appear to prevent hospitalizations and death even when new variants are the cause of infection. Many vaccine developers are working on booster shots and new inoculations that could preserve a high level of efficacy against the variants. And, scientists say there is still much to be learned about the immune system\u2019s ability to combat the virus. Already, COVID-19 infection rates have declined in many countries since the start of 2021, with some dramatic reductions in severe illness and hospitalizations among the first groups of people to be vaccinated. Murray said if the South African variant, or similar mutants, continue to spread rapidly, the number of COVID-19 cases resulting in hospitalization or death this coming winter could be four times higher than the flu. The rough estimate assumes a 65% effective vaccine given to half of a country\u2019s population. In a worst-case scenario, that could represent as many as 200,000 U.S. deaths related to COVID-19 over the winter period, based on federal government estimates of annual flu fatalities. His institute\u2019s current forecast, which runs to June 1, assumes there will be an additional 62,000 U.S. deaths and 690,000 global deaths from COVID-19 by that point. The model includes assumptions about vaccination rates as well as the transmissibility of the South African and Brazilian variants. The shift in thinking among scientists has influenced more cautious government statements about when the pandemic will end. Britain last week said it expects a slow emergence from one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns, despite having one of the fastest vaccination drives. U.S. government predictions of a return to a more normal lifestyle have been repeatedly pushed back, most recently from late summer to Christmas, and then to March 2022. Israel issues \u201cGreen Pass\u201d immunity documents to people who have recovered from COVID-19 or been vaccinated, allowing them back into hotels or theatres. The documents are only valid for six months because it\u2019s not clear how long immunity will last. \u201cWhat does it mean to be past the emergency phase of this pandemic?,\u201d said Stefan Baral, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. While some experts have asked whether countries could completely eradicate any case of COVID-19 through vaccines and stringent lockdowns, Baral sees the goals as more modest, but still meaningful. \u201cIn my mind, it\u2019s that hospitals aren\u2019t full, the ICUs aren\u2019t full, and people aren\u2019t tragically passing,\u201d he said. From the beginning, the new coronavirus has been a moving target. Early in the pandemic, leading scientists warned that the virus could become endemic and \u201cmay never go away,\u201d including Dr. Michael Ryan, head of the World Health Organization\u2019s emergencies program. Yet they had much to learn, including whether it would be possible to develop a vaccine against the virus and how quickly it would mutate. Would it be more like measles, which can be kept almost entirely at bay in communities with high rates of inoculation, or flu, which infects millions globally each year? For much of 2020, many scientists were surprised and reassured that the coronavirus had not changed significantly enough to become more transmissible, or deadly. A major breakthrough came in November. Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE as well as Moderna Inc said their vaccines were around 95% effective at preventing COVID-19 in clinical trials, an efficacy rate that is much higher than any flu shot. At least a few of the scientists Reuters interviewed said even in the wake of those results, they hadn\u2019t expected the vaccines to wipe out the virus. But many told Reuters that the data raised hope within the scientific community that it would be possible to virtually eliminate COVID-19, if only the world could be vaccinated quickly enough. \u201cWe all felt quite optimistic before Christmas with those first vaccines,\u201d said Azra Ghani, chair in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London. \u201cWe didn\u2019t necessarily expect such high-efficacy vaccines to be possible in that first generation.\u201d The optimism proved short-lived. In late December, the UK warned of a new, more transmissible variant that was quickly becoming the dominant form of the coronavirus in the country. Around the same time, researchers learned of the impact of the faster-spreading variants in South Africa and in Brazil. Phil Dormitzer, a top vaccine scientist at Pfizer, told Reuters in November that the U.S. drugmaker\u2019s vaccine success signaled the virus was \u201cvulnerable to immunization\u201d in what he called \u201ca breakthrough for humanity.\u201d By early January, he acknowledged the variants heralded \u201ca new chapter\u201d in which companies will have to constantly monitor for mutations that could dampen the effect of vaccines. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In late January, the impact on vaccines became even clearer. Novavax\u2019s clinical trial data showed its vaccine was 89% effective in a UK trial, but just 50% effective at preventing COVID-19 in South Africa. That was followed a week later by data showing the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine offered only limited protection from mild disease against the South African variant. The most recent change of heart was considerable, several of the scientists told Reuters. Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, described it as \u201cscientific whiplash\u201d: In December, he had believed it was plausible to achieve so-called \u201cfunctional eradication\u201d of the coronavirus, similar to measles. Now, \u201cgetting as many people vaccinated as possible is still the same answer and the same path forward as it was on December 1 or January 1,\u201d Crotty said, \u201cbut the expected outcome isn\u2019t the same.\u201d"},

It also means eased rules for college and university athletic programs. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Effective Monday, restrictions are eased for child, youth and adult performances as well, including dance, theatre, singing and wind instruments. Larger indoor film, TV and theatre production is permitted under Step 2, as long as there are no live audiences and the company submits a proposal to implement proven prevention steps to the government. Community halls, banquet halls, conference centres and hotels can open for activities that are allowed under steps 1 and 2 (like wedding ceremonies with a maximum of 10 people or funeral services with a maximum of 20 people). Receptions are still not permitted in any venue. \u201cWe\u2019ll be discussing Step 3 on March 22 at the earliest,\u201d Shandro said. \u201cToday is another sign of hope.\u201d Chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said 297,600 vaccine doses have been administered and   with two doses. \u201cProtection from any vaccine, including those for COVID-19, doesn\u2019t happen overnight.

It is being upgraded to prepare for the next wave of eligible Albertans. Starting March 10 at 8 a.m., Albertans born in 1957 will be eligible to book an appointment for a Covishield/AstraZeneca vaccine. Booking appointments will be opened based on age and will be expanded to other birth years one year at a time. \u201cWe will offer to younger individuals if supply allows,\u201d Hinshaw said. Pharmacies are not administering the AstraZeneca vaccine at this time, she said, so eligible Albertans should call 811 or book online through AHS. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Beginning the week of March 15, Alberta will be expanding the vaccine rollout to include Phase 2A, which includes Albertans between 65 and 74 and First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis people aged 50 and older. Appointments will be available by age group. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t On Monday, Kenney also said he hopes to encourage as many Albertans as possible to receive the shots. \u201cThink of others. Think of the vulnerable in particular,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can see, as more and more folks get vaccinated, that it\u2019s safe, and that it\u2019s effective. \u201cIf we want to get our lives back, to get freedom back, then we have to have the most people as possible take that vaccine.\u201d Hinshaw said 278 new cases of COVID-19 had been identified in the last 24 hours, out of about 5,500 tests. That puts Alberta\u2019s positivity rate at about 5.4 per cent. Six new cases of COVID-19 variant were identified, bringing the provincial total to 659. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The R value for Alberta sits at 0.95. \u201cIt is promising to have a R value below one,\u201d Hinshaw said. As of Monday, there were 254 people in hospital with COVID-19, 36 of whom were in intensive care. Alberta Health said six additional deaths had been reported over the last 48 hours. All six cases included comorbidities, the province said. One of the fatalities was linked to the outbreak at Churchill Manor in Edmonton \u2014 a woman in her 60s died. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t A man in his 70s from the Edmonton zone also died, along with three people in the South zone: a man in his 80s, a woman in her 50s and a man in his 70s.

However, she said the same cannot be said for these vulnerable groups. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same data for those with these specific medical conditions. We\u2019re erring on the side of caution,\u201d she said. The province is currently spacing doses up to 16 weeks apart to try and get as many first doses into the arms of Albertans.  . However, organizations such as Lymphoma Canada, Myeloma Canada, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of Canada, Lung Cancer Canada and CLL Canada sent a letter to Health Minister Tyler Shandro on April 1 requesting that doses be spaced out according to manufacturers\u2019 guidelines for blood cancer patients, cancer patients on active treatment and immunocompromised survivors. The letter, signed by 27 doctors from across the country, cites research showing that the immune response in seniors and cancer patients after the first dose is reduced compared to healthy individuals but is boosted when the second dose is administered within three weeks. Lorelei Dalrymple, interim president of the Myeloma Alberta Support Society, said earlier on Thursday that the society is in the process of starting up a letter-writing campaign to MLAs, AHS, Hinshaw and Health Minister Tyler Shandro. \u201c(To) hopefully capture their support in making sure vulnerable people are being put at the top of the queue for getting their second dose,\u201d she said.

Why hasn\u2019t Canada? - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted July 28, 2020 1:50 pm", "body": "As countries around the world are jockeying to secure a supply of vaccines under development for the novel  , many are striking advance deals with biopharmaceutical giants. But Canada doesn\u2019t appear to have done the same \u2014 at least, not yet. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t One expert says Canada could face challenges or a delay in getting its hands on a vaccine if it doesn\u2019t act faster to pre-order doses of promising international vaccine candidates. \u201cWe are now in a position where, even if everything goes beautifully, we\u2019re going to get the vaccine months later than the U.S. and Europe, too,\u201d said Amir Attaran, a law professor at the   who holds a doctorate in immunology. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a major pharmaceutical industry in this country. There is no company that is going to be able to compete with the global companies that have entered this space already. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t A number of countries have pre-ordered millions of vaccine doses. The United Kingdom, for example, is first in line to receive 30 million doses from British drugmaker AstraZeneca, which plans to manufacture a promising   vaccine developed by Oxford University (if it proves successful). France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands have also signed a contract with AstraZeneca that would see the drugmaker deliver   of that vaccine. The four-member group has said the supply would be made available to all European Union countries. The United States, too, has struck a deal with AstraZeneca to set aside at least 300 million doses of the vaccine and also signed a contract with Pfizer for   of a vaccine that company is working to develop.   has also pre-ordered from Pfizer and others. With more than 100 vaccine candidates in progress, how do Canada\u2019s efforts to procure a safe vaccine compare? Here\u2019s what you need to know. The Liberal government has so far pledged investments totalling over $1.2 billion in domestic and international COVID-19 medical research and vaccine development. In May, the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada   it would work with China\u2019s CanSino Biologics Inc. to produce and distribute a vaccine here in Canada, if the clinical trials are successful.   published ahead of that vaccine\u2019s testing in Canada, found it to be safe and effective at prompting an immune response to the virus. Ottawa has also funded other domestic projects, including a vaccine candidate under development at the University of Saskatchewan\u2019s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre. In anticipation of a vaccine, the federal government has also moved to stockpile a number of vaccine supplies, including  , saying it intends to purchase enough of those supplies   for every Canadian. \u201cCertainly, there\u2019s a lot of work being done to ensure when a vaccine becomes available, it can be administered in a pretty effective and efficient manner, from the time it becomes available,\u201d infectious disease physician Isaac Bogoch told Global News\u2019 Farah Nasser on Monday. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t But unlike the U.S. and the U.K., the federal government hasn\u2019t signed any advance purchase agreements with any other international players. While Attaran believes the CanSino vaccine will work, he argued it likely won\u2019t be the first one to the finish line \u2014 and it\u2019s not the only international candidate with potential. Attaran said the research team behind the Oxford vaccine has been \u201cgrinding away\u201d at its adenovirus vaccine technology for years, which gave it a \u201cjump start\u201d in the COVID-19 context. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Aside from that one, however, there are other leading vaccine candidates internationally, based on both older, well-established technology and newer, more \u201cradical\u201d technology, Attaran said. He said Canada is jeopardizing its access to a timely vaccine supply the longer it holds out on signing a contract with major biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies backing vaccine candidates, like Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson. The federal government says it\u2019s \u201cclosely monitoring vaccine development efforts\u201d both in Canada and internationally and suggested it is exploring making pre-orders of vaccine doses. \u201cThe Government of Canada \u2026 is working to negotiate advanced purchase agreements with vaccine manufacturers to secure supply for Canadians as soon as it is feasible,\u201d said a statement from Health Canada, which didn\u2019t specify how many negotiations are ongoing. With a number of vaccine candidates in progress worldwide, it\u2019s \u201cnot possible\u201d right now to know which ones will be successful and because of that, Ottawa is supporting \u201cmultiple organizations,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBy supporting vaccine research and development, bio-manufacturing requirements to support large-scale production, enhancing capacity and access for clinical trials, and seeking solutions for domestic capacity, Canada will be in a better position to rapidly access a vaccine, once one becomes available,\u201d Health Canada said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t A vaccine task force, comprised of experts independent from government and who specialize in vaccination, vaccine development and infectious diseases, is reviewing the options and reporting to the federal ministers of health and innovation, Canada\u2019s chief public health officer said on Tuesday. \u201cUltimately, the spending and how the money is spent is up to the government itself, but the task force will provide advice,\u201d Dr. Theresa Tam said. \u201cI think one can appreciate that with over 120 candidates right now globally, with quite a number of them being Canadian candidates as well, there\u2019s a lot of evolving information every single day.\u201d Tam added she believes the task force meets two or three times weekly to \u201creview the ongoing evidence\u201d and the options are \u201call being considered and evaluated \u201cThere are active discussions right now going on with a whole range of manufacturers that have promising candidates but I can\u2019t speak as to where these discussions have got to,\u201d she said, echoing Health Canada.

The new guidance also shouldn\u2019t replace the public health measures already put in place to help curb the spread of COVID-19, Tam added. \u201cYou must continue to practise physical distancing and good hygiene by frequent handwashing and regularly disinfect high-touch surfaces,\u201d she said. Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu hesitated to call the new guidance on face coverings a blanket recommendation. \u201cThere are certain circumstances where an individual may feel that they are not able to practise the physical distancing of two metres and would like to take additional measures to protect the people around them,\u201d she said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Tam said it\u2019s still not known how big a role pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission play in \u201cdriving\u201d the pandemic but officials know it\u2019s occurring from recent studies. \u201cIt is clear that transmission of the virus is happening more often than previously recognized from infected people right before they develop symptoms,\u201d she said. Tam urged Canadians to leave the supply of medical-grade masks for health-care workers, which aligns with guidance from the   (WHO), which also addressed the mask debate on Monday. The WHO said it was \u201cevaluating\u201d the wider use of medical and non-medical masks amid the pandemic and issuing \u201cguidance and criteria to support countries\u201d as they review their public health recommendations. \u201cFor example, countries could consider using masks in communities where other measures such as cleaning hands and physical distancing are harder to achieve because of lack of water or cramped living conditions,\u201d WHO director-general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. Tedros said there\u2019s \u201climited research\u201d on the use of masks among the general population and asked countries considering their wider use to \u201cstudy their effectiveness so we can all learn.\u201d The new guidance from Ottawa on non-medical masks comes three days after  , recommending that citizens cover their face when outside their homes to help slow the spread of the virus. As of April 6, there were 15,806 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus across Canada,  . To date, the deaths of 293 people have been linked to the virus in the country, the agency says."},

The U.S. overtook China as the country with the highest number of infections. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t As the number of infections worldwide reached a half-million and deaths climbed past 23,000, the damage to people\u2019s livelihoods and their well-being from the effort to flatten the rising curve started to come into focus. In India, where the country\u2019s 1.3 billion people were under orders to stay home, legions of poor were suddenly thrown out of work, and many families were left struggling for something to eat. \u201cOur first concern is food, not the virus,\u201d said Suresh Kumar, 60, a bicycle rickshaw rider in New Delhi whose family of six relies on his daily earnings of 300 rupees, or $4. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I will manage.\u201d India has the world\u2019s second-highest number of people living in extreme poverty. Rickshaw drivers, produce peddlers, maids, day labourers and other low-wage workers form the backbone of the economy, and many live day to day on their pay and have no savings to fall back on. The Indian government announced a 1.7 trillion rupee ($22 billion) economic stimulus package that will deliver monthly rations of grain and lentils to a staggering 800 million people. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Around the globe, the death toll rose to about 8,200 in Italy, 4,100 in Spain and 1,700 in France, including a 16-year-old. The U.S. had about 1,200 deaths, about 400 of them in New York State, the worst hotspot in the nation. Most of those victims were in New York City, where hospitals are getting swamped. On Thursday, a running count kept by Johns Hopkins University showed the United States now had the most confirmed cases of any country, with more than 82,000. Italy and China, the latter of which was the origin of the outbreak late last year, both had more than 80,000. Louisiana was quickly becoming another smouldering hotspot. The number of new cases there jumped by more than 500 Thursday, for a total of over 2,300, with 86 deaths, including a 17-year-old, the health department said. The higher infection numbers reflected an increase in testing. New Orleans was gearing up for a possible overflow at hospitals, with plans to treat as many as 3,000 patients at the city\u2019s convention centre. From New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue and London\u2019s Piccadilly Circus to the boulevards of Paris and the streets of Rome and Madrid, restaurants, hotels, airlines, giant chains and small shops are all shuttered, and factories across both continents have ground to a halt, as cities, states and entire countries have ordered the closing of nonessential businesses and instructed people to stay home. Companies in Europe are laying off workers at the fastest pace since 2009, according to surveys of business managers. And the U.S. is bleeding jobs as well: The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits last week was nearly five times the old record, set in 1982. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Dann Dykas, 37, of Portland, Oregon, was laid off from his job helping design and set up displays for trade shows. \u201cEverything is so surreal,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t even get an interview for another job, and we now have to worry more about being careful and taking care of ourselves.\u201d In Georgia, 33-year-old Ian Smith was let go from his job at a wine bar and is working \u201cside hustles\u201d and relying on the generosity of friends. \u201cOn my worst days, it\u2019s hopelessness, and on some of my better days, it\u2019s `What possibility can I create in all of this?\u201d\u2019 he said. \u201cI can\u2019t pretend that I always feel that, though.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In a rare positive sign, stocks rallied on Wall Street for the third straight day after an unprecedented $2.2 trillion economic rescue package to help businesses, hospitals and ordinary Americans pull through the crisis won passage in the Senate. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 1,350 points, or over 6 per cent. The rescue plan, which is expected to be voted on in the House on Friday, would dispense checks of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, announced that federal officials are developing guidelines to rate counties by risk of virus spread, as he aims to ease the restrictions meant to slow the outbreak. Italy, the eurozone\u2019s third-biggest economy and a major exporter of machinery, textiles and other goods, became perhaps the first Western developed nation to idle most of its industry, extending a shutdown on smaller, nonessential businesses to heavy manufacturers. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Among the companies in Italy that have shut down or rolled back production: Fiat Chrysler, Ferrari, Pirelli tires and Luxottica eyewear, maker of Ray-Bans and Oakleys. The industrial lobby Confindustria estimates a cost of 70 billion to 100 billion euros ($77 billion-$110 billion) of national wealth a month if 70 per cent of companies are closed, as anticipated. \u201cWe are entering a war economy,\u201d said Confindustria President Vincenzo Boccia. Elsewhere around the world, South Africa, with the most industrialized economy in Africa, headed into a three-week lockdown starting Friday. The country is already in recession, with an unemployment rate of 29 per cent. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t And Britain unveiled another relief effort, this time aimed at the gig economy, many of whose workers are facing financial ruin. The government will give the self-employed grants equal to 80 per cent of their average monthly profits, up to 2,500 pounds ($2,975) per month. In other developments: For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. So far, more than 120,000 people have recovered, according to the Johns Hopkins University tally. \u00a0"},

The federal government also created a task force Thursday to oversee blood-test surveys to see how widely the virus has spread in Canada and provide reliable estimates of immunity and vulnerabilities among Canadians. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The new cash builds on $275 million in research funding the Liberals announced in March at the outset of the pandemic. Most of the new money is aimed at funding vaccine development and clinical trials, including $600 million over two years through a federal innovation fund. Smaller amounts will support scientific efforts to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19 and a project led by Genome Canada to track the virus, its different strains and how it makes people ill in different ways. \u201cA vaccine, obviously, arriving soon would be the best solution,\u201d Trudeau told a news briefing outside his Ottawa residence. But he said it may be a long while before a vaccine emerges, and there are discussions about treatments for COVID-19 that might also be effective. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve been waiting for and looking for and searching for a vaccine for AIDS for decades now and it still hasn\u2019t come. But there are treatments that mean quality of life for people with HIV have been massively improved,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cThere are different ways of moving through. We will take the best ways we possibly can as we move forward.\u201d The new COVID-19 immunity task force will operate under the direction of a group that includes Theresa Tam, the country\u2019s chief medical officer, and Mona Nemer, the chief federal science adviser. \u201cThey\u2019ll be looking at key questions like how many people beyond those we\u2019ve already tested have had COVID-19, whether you\u2019re immune once you\u2019ve had it and, if so, how long that lasts,\u201d Trudeau said. The government expects at least one million Canadians will be tested over two years as part of the study. The current standard testing checks for the presence of the virus now, but immunity testing identifies antibodies that reveal who has been exposed to the virus previously, Nemer told a briefing Thursday. Together, the two will provide a better picture of the overall number of people who have been infected. Data will help with everything from rollouts of a potential vaccine to determining which public health measures are most effective. \u201cThe better we understand this virus, its spread and its impact on different people, the better we can fight it and eventually defeat it,\u201d Trudeau said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t About 20,000 Canadians are being tested daily to see if they have COVID-19, almost double the number earlier this month. But testing must accelerate even further before Canadians can begin resuming their usual activities, the prime minister said. The various initiatives outlined Thursday are about empowering scientists and researchers and giving them tools they need, said Innovation, Science and Industry Minister Navdeep Bains. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cScience is a fundamental component to beating COVID-19 and in order for us to move ahead we need to search for and develop therapeutics and vaccines and we need to have the capacity to manufacture them in Canada as well,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThis made-in-Canada solution and this mobilization effort is very much focused on the health crisis, but also going to benefit Canada in the medium and long-term as well.\u201d"},

Jay Inslee directed state agencies to use \u201call resources necessary\u201d to prepare for and respond to the coronavirus outbreak. The declaration also allows the use of the Washington National Guard, if necessary. \u201cWe will continue to work toward a day where no one dies from this virus,\u201d the governor vowed. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Health officials in California, Oregon and Washington state are worried about the novel coronavirus spreading through West Coast communities because a growing number of people are being infected despite not having visited an area where there was an outbreak, nor apparently been in contact with anyone who had. The man who died was in his 50s, had underlying health conditions and no history of travel or contact with a known COVID-19 case, health officials in Washington state said at a news conference. A spokesperson for EvergreenHealth Medical Center, Kayse Dahl, said the person died in the facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland. Dr. Frank Riedo, medical director of Infection Control at Evergreen, said local hospitals are seeing people with severe coronavirus symptoms but it\u2019s probable that there are more cases in the community. \u201cThis is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he said. The health officials reported two cases of COVID-19 virus connected to a long-term care facility in the same suburb, Life Care Center of Kirkland. One is a Life Care worker, a woman in her 40s who is in satisfactory condition at a hospital, and the other is a woman in her 70s and a resident at Life Care who is hospitalized in serious condition. Neither had travelled abroad. \u201cIn addition, over 50 individuals associated with Life Care are reportedly ill with respiratory symptoms or hospitalized with pneumonia or other respiratory conditions of unknown cause and are being tested for COVID-19,\u201d Seattle and King County officials said. \u201cAdditional positive cases are expected.\u201d Amy Reynolds of the Washington state health department said in a brief telephone interview: \u201cWe are dealing with an emergency evolving situation.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t No one answered the phone at Life Care, but Ellie Basham, its executive director, said in a statement that residents and employees are being monitored and those with symptoms or who were potentially exposed are quarantined. The facility has banned families, volunteers and vendors as a precaution, Basham said. A growing number of cases in California, Washington state and Oregon are confounding authorities because the infected people hadn\u2019t recently travelled overseas or had any known close contact with a traveller or an infected person. The Santa Clara County Public Health Department announced Saturday the case of a fourth person in the county infected with coronavirus, The case is of a woman who is a \u201chousehold contact\u201d of a person who is hospitalized with the virus, the health department said in a news release. The woman has not been hospitalized and is not ill, the department said. The U.S. has about 60 confirmed cases. Worldwide, the number of people sickened by the virus hovered Friday around 83,000, and there were more than 2,800 deaths, most of them in China. A 60-year-old U.S. citizen died in Wuhan in early February. Most infections result in mild symptoms, including coughing and fever, though some can become more serious and lead to pneumonia. Older people, especially those with chronic illnesses such as heart or lung disease, are especially vulnerable. Health officials think it spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads. The number of coronavirus cases in the United States is considered small. But convinced that they will grow, health agencies are ramping up efforts to identify those who might be sick. To achieve more rapid testing capacity, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an accelerated policy Saturday enabling laboratories to use tests they develop. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said his agency is \u201crapidly responding and adapting to this dynamic and evolving situation.\u201d The California Department of Public Health said Friday that the state will receive enough kits from the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention to test up to 1,200 people a day for the COVID-19 virus \u2014 a day after Gov. Gavin Newsom complained to federal health officials that the state had already exhausted its initial 200 test kits. Oregon was able to more quickly identify a case \u2014 an employee of an elementary school in Lake Oswego near Portland because it was able to test a sample locally. School district officials said Saturday the employee had been visited in the hospital by several people before he was diagnosed. Those individuals have been asked to observe a two-week quarantine and are being closely monitored. Worried shoppers thronged a Costco box store near Lake Oswego, emptying shelves of items including toilet paper, paper towels, bottled water, frozen berries and black beans. \u201cToilet paper is golden in an apocalypse,\u201d one Costco employee said. Employees said the store ran out of toilet paper for the first time in its history and that it was the busiest they had ever seen, including during Christmas Eve. The district is deep-cleaning all its schools and all school buses with the goal of having students back in class Monday, said Superintendent Lora de la Cruz. But Forest Hills Elementary, where the man worked, is closed until Wednesday, marking two weeks since he was last at the school. Earlier U.S. cases include three people who were evacuated from the central China city of Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak; 14 people who returned from China, or their spouses; and 42 American passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, who were flown to U.S. military bases in California and Texas for quarantining. The U.S. government looked at sending dozens of Californians, several of whom tested positive for the virus, who had been aboard the cruise ship to a state-owned facility in Costa Mesa, California. Local officials objected, saying they weren\u2019t included in the planning and wanting to know what safeguards would be in place to prevent spread of the virus. The U.S. government said it didn\u2019t need to use the facility after all. At UC Davis Medical Center in California, at least 124 registered nurses and other health care workers were sent home for \u201cself-quarantine\u201d after a Solano County woman with the virus was admitted, National Nurses United, a nationwide union representing registered nurses, said Friday. The case \u201chighlights the vulnerability of the nation\u2019s hospitals to this virus,\u201d the union said. Washington state health officials announced two other new coronavirus cases Friday night, including a high school student who attends Jackson High School in Everett, said Dr. Chris Spitters of the Snohomish County Health District. The other case in Washington was a woman in in King County in her 50s who had recently travelled to South Korea, authorities said. Neither patient was seriously ill."},
{"title": "Canada easing COVID-19 hotel quarantine, isolation rules for fully vaccinated: source  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted June 9, 2021 8:53 am", "body": "The federal government is set to announce Wednesday that fully vaccinated Canadian travellers will no longer need to spend 14 days in   quarantine upon arriving home. A federal source familiar with the policy says the change will go into effect in early July. The source spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss a policy decision that has yet to be made public. It will apply to Canadian citizens and permanent residents who have had a full course of a COVID-19 vaccine. Affected travellers will be required to take a COVID-19 test upon arrival in Canada, and remain in isolation until the test comes back negative. The government will also eliminate the need for fully vaccinated Canadian air travellers to spend three days quarantining in an authorized hotel upon arriving in the country. A federal advisory panel recommended getting rid of the hotel quarantine late last month given that those with the means to pay a fine can avoid the program and as case counts decline. Countries around the world shut down their borders last year as the novel coronavirus spread. The Canadian government barred non-essential foreign nationals and warned Canadians against non-essential travel outside the country in March 2020. Officials later adjusted the rules to require negative COVID-19 PCR tests prior to and after arrival, a period of mandatory quarantine and fines for ignoring it, and limits on which airports could accept incoming international arrivals. In February 2021, the government also announced travellers arriving in the country would have to quarantine at their own expense in a government-authorized hotel. Only after receiving a negative COVID-19 test could they continue their total 14-day quarantine at home. Canadians who can afford to pay a fine \u2014\u00a0 \u00a0\u2014 have been able to ignore the quarantine hotel requirement. Data from the Public Health Agency of Canada suggests less than one per cent of those fined for refusing the hotel quarantine tested positive for COVID-19."},
{"title": "Bowling alleys, bars, arcades: Are indoor venues safe as COVID-19 restrictions ease? - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted July 16, 2020 5:00 am", "body": "Experts have said the risk of the   spreading is  , but many indoor recreational activities are beginning to open. Indoor facilities like bars, arcades, escape rooms, bowling alleys, interactive museum exhibits and pool halls will be reopening on Friday in the majority of Ontario, as the province moves to Stage 3 of its plan to reopen. But in Quebec, the province hardest hit by the virus, bars have already reopened and have been  . Here is what experts have to say about how safe indoor spaces are and what precautions should be taken when venturing out. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cPeople are still expected to maintain two metres\u2019 distance,\u201d said Greta Bauer, an epidemiology professor at Western University. \u201cThey\u2019re expected to wear masks where that can\u2019t be done. The question is going to really be how that\u2019s operationalized in those spaces.\u201d Bauer said creating environments that give the virus opportunities to spread increases the risk of outbreaks. Gerald Evans, professor and chair of the infectious diseases division of the department of medicine at Queen\u2019s University, said the problem is simple: \u201cIndoor spaces are not as safe as outdoor spaces.\u201d \u201cWhen you\u2019re outdoors, there\u2019s a massive dilutional effect of the atmosphere and there\u2019s winds and breezes that are blowing things around. So the likelihood of respiratory droplets infecting someone is markedly reduced outside as compared with inside,\u201d he said. Evans said whether or not these spaces will become hotbeds for   depends on several variables, including the size of the venue, how well-ventilated it is and what measures are put in place before people are allowed inside. Epidemiologists interviewed by Global News agreed that bars, pool halls and other spots where alcohol is served pose a significant risk. \u201cSuper-spreader events\u201d in countries like South Korea have clearly been tied to bars and young people, said Evans.  , a single individual in their 20s who attended a nightclub after they contracted the virus resulted in a spike of 34 contact cases. \u201cWhat we found out in the last two months is that bars are really dangerous. It\u2019s a bad mixture. It\u2019s a return to an environment which is inherently challenging,\u201d Evans said. \u201cPeople can\u2019t necessarily wear masks effectively in a bar because you\u2019re drinking. Alcohol impairs your judgment. So you may do things that you shouldn\u2019t do, even though you know that you shouldn\u2019t do it, and there are often small areas with inadequate ventilation.\u201d Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Toronto, called bars \u201cextremely worrisome.\u201d \u201cAfter a couple of drinks, physical distancing gets harder to do and people don\u2019t go to bars so they can stand more than six feet away from other people. Karaoke is even worse because singing means projecting a lot of droplets and no one karaokes to an empty room,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re standing around, there\u2019s a lot of people and they\u2019re not wearing masks and they\u2019re inside, that\u2019s unsafe. Full stop.\u201d Arcades, while typically a more sober activity among friends, also pose some risks, experts said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot less ventilation,\u201d said Evans, and young people are not \u201cparticularly attuned to\u201d following the rules of \u201cthe new normal,\u201d such as physical distancing, mask-wearing and remaining two metres apart. \u201cAn arcade room could be particularly dangerous if people aren\u2019t screened, people aren\u2019t wearing masks, or if it\u2019s a small facility with a lot of people in it. That\u2019s a great, unfortunate way to transmit the virus,\u201d he added. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Experts said escape rooms, on the other hand, could provide a safer alternative \u2014 provided they\u2019re well maintained and thoroughly cleaned after each use. Room scenarios usually host between four and 12 people, many of whom are friends. \u201cIt\u2019s typically it\u2019s a group of people who know each other who go into that room and then try to solve all the puzzles in order to escape,\u201d said Evans. \u201cThat could be intrinsically a little bit safer simply because you\u2019re likely to do it within a circle of individuals who you\u2019ve already deemed to be your social circle.\u201d Interactive museum exhibitions can pose challenges, depending on the level of interaction. A normal stroll through a museum, where patrons are discouraged from touching the art and artifacts, poses minimal risk, \u201cespecially because it\u2019s not a strenuous exercise,\u201d Evans said. As long as guests wear masks and are properly screened, few problems should arise. The interactive part, however, \u201cis a little bit more difficult.\u201d Furness noted that museums had been particularly careful to the extent that they\u2019re opening. \u201cThey\u2019re being very careful about limiting the number of people inside,\u201d he said. He added that the type of experience museums offer, which tends to be less of a party and more of an airy, quiet place to appreciate the arts, may not pose the same risk as indoor activities where sweating and dancing are involved. Bowling alleys, too, are on the safer end of the spectrum of indoor activities reopening across the country. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly large indoor space there, depending on the size of the bowling lane and alleys there,\u201d said Evans. \u201cIn that large expanse, with a fair bit of good ventilation and if you\u2019re keeping the numbers down, that\u2019s generally a safer place.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Whether or not parts of the country are reopening prematurely is up for debate. \u201cWe\u2019re not even sure that it\u2019s safe to open schools in September,\u201d Furness said. \u201cIf we\u2019re not sure we can send kids back to school, I don\u2019t think we should be opening bars, arcades and escape rooms.\u201d But as provinces and territories reopen and the number of interactions between people increases, Bauer said to expect to a rise in COVID-19 cases. \u201cWe will have larger outbreaks just because we\u2019re increasing the number of contacts that people will potentially have had if they do become a case of COVID-19,\u201d she said."},

Indoor group fitness classes and team sports will be prohibited for two weeks from Nov. 13-27, Premier Jason Kenney announced Thursday afternoon. This applies to the Calgary area, Edmonton area, Fort McMurray, Grande Prairie, Lethbridge and Red Deer. The above restrictions do not apply to junior, college and university sports. Kenney said they have additional public health measures in place to limit the risk of exposure. Restaurants and pubs in the above areas, as well as areas on \u201c \u201d must stop liquor sales by 10 p.m. and close by 11 p.m. This measure will also be in place from Nov. 13-27. Kenney also said amateur singing, dancing and theatre groups will also have to take a two-week break when enhanced pandemic measures begin Friday. \u201cThis two-week push is, I believe, our last chance to avoid more restrictive measures that I and most Albertans desperately want to avoid,\u201d Kenney said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Additional public health measures will also be implemented in all regions under enhanced status. The following measures will be in place until further notice: \u201cThese measures collectively are meant to reduce the number of close contacts that Albertans have with others in the weeks to come to try aggressively to bring our numbers down,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cThis must be taken seriously. We are putting our faith in the good judgement of Albertans.\u201d Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw said the measures announced Thursday target areas of risk. \u201cWe know that as community transmission grows and as our positivity rates increase in many areas across the province, that when you have a group of people coming together, potentially engaging in activities like fitness activities, exercise or singing, that those are the kinds of activities that can potentially cause spread from one to many if there is a bit of a deviation or a slip up in the protocols.\u201d Hinshaw stressed the opportunity for these measures to be effective rests in Albertans\u2019 hands. \u201cWe want to encourage all Albertans to go above and beyond, to look at these measures and embrace them for two weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can put a dedicated effort into reducing our close contacts, to distancing, to masking \u2014 if we can do all of those things together, that is the opportunity to have these measures make a difference.\u201d The province said these measures will be monitored and additional measures will be implemented if needed. \u201cThis is our chance,\u201d Kenney said from home via teleconference. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that I do not want to take an approach that restricts people\u2019s fundamental rights and freedoms, their ability to gain a livelihood \u2014 I\u2019m concerned about the broader social and health impacts of those things. However, if Albertans do not respond in a significant way over the next two weeks, we will have to consider additional targeted restrictive measures.\u201d Kenney said if the government continues to see large private parties, \u201cwe may have to consider enforcement action\u201d with fines being a possibility. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The restrictions come as 860 new cases of COVID-19 were reported Thursday, along with 10 additional deaths from the disease. Alberta\u2019s COVID-19 death toll has now reached 393. \u201cCOVID is starting to win and we cannot let that happen,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost certain that we\u2019ve not yet seen the peak of the current increase.\u201d There were three deaths linked to the outbreak at the South Terrace Care Centre in Edmonton, which Alberta Health said were previously reported by Alberta Health Services. A man in his 60s, a man in his 70s and a woman in her 90s died. There were three deaths linked to outbreaks at continuing care centres in the Calgary zone: a man in his 90s from Mount Royal Revera, a man in his 90s from Staywell Manor and a woman in her 90s from Extendicare Hillcrest. The remaining deaths were not linked to continuing care and included a man in his 70s and two men in their 80s from the Calgary zone, as well as a man in his 80s from the Edmonton zone. There were 225 people in hospital with COVID-19 Thursday, with 51 of those being treated in intensive care. Kenney said the daily cases, hospitalizations and COVID-19 patients receiving intensive care are all more than double what they were at the height of the first wave of the pandemic last spring. He said 16 outbreaks are currently affecting nine health-care facilities across the province. \u201cOur rising community spread is putting our health-care system under real stress,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cWe are at a dangerous juncture in our province.\u201d Thursday\u2019s data pushed the number of active cases in Alberta to 8,305, the majority of which were in the Edmonton and Calgary zones. Active cases of COVID:19 Thursday by zone: More than 430 Alberta doctors and three major health unions wrote a letter to Kenney earlier Thursday, urging him to invoke short, sharp public health restrictions to reverse the soaring rate of COVID-19. Dr. Joe Vipond is an emergency room doctor at Rockyview General Hospital in Calgary who signed the letter. He said in an interview Thursday morning that the province needs to focus on closing things like bars and in-restaurant dining. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government has quite grasped the seriousness of where we\u2019re at and the depth of what we need to do in order to get out of this,\u201d Vipond said. \u201cWe can actually forecast the future because we\u2019ve seen other jurisdictions walk down this moderate pathway \u2014 or these half measures \u2014 and it\u2019s not pretty. So we know things are going to get much worse.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Vipond also said the government needs to implement mandatory masking across the province and provide better support for schools by making masks mandatory in classrooms and ensuring all schools have proper ventilation."},

The province expects to receive weekly shipments of more than 785,000 doses from Pfizer-BioNTech in May, and more than 938,000 doses per week next month. Health Minister Christine Elliott said Monday that the added supply might allow the province to shorten the current four-month interval between the first and second shots. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe expect that with the much larger quantities of the Pfizer vaccines that we\u2019re receiving throughout the month of May, that we may well be able to shorten the timeline for people to receive their second doses,\u201d Elliott said. If that happens, people will be contacted to arrange a new time for their second appointment, the health minister said, adding that the new interval would be closer to the original timeline for vaccinations. Pfizer recommends a 21-day interval between its two shots, while Moderna recommends four weeks and Oxford-AstraZeneca advises between four and twelve weeks. Ontario extended the interval between doses earlier this year during a period of slow vaccine supply to Canada, making some exceptions for certain at-risk individuals. While larger Pfizer-BioNTech shipments are expected in the coming weeks, incoming supplies of other approved vaccines are less plentiful, and less certain. The province is expecting 388,000 Moderna vaccine doses during the week of May 10, and further supply of Oxford-AstraZeneca in the coming months has yet to be confirmed. Ontario officials confirmed Monday that the province has asked a federal vaccine advisory group to look into the possibility of mixing doses between the first and second shots. Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Ontario\u2019s associate medical officer of health, said Monday that the province had asked the National Advisory Committee on Immunization to make recommendations about potentially mixing vaccines. She said the province was waiting to see the results of a U.K. study looking at the effectiveness of the mixed-vaccine dose approach, but the results aren\u2019t expected until next month. She said Ontario has asked for recommendations from the Canadian body by mid-May. \u201cLikely (NACI) will recommend that it is safe and effective to use a different vaccine for the second shot, if you cannot get the same one you got for the first one,\u201d Yaffe said Monday. Dr. David Williams, Ontario\u2019s top doctor, said the priority is to protect as many people as possible from COVID-19 as the province battles a deadly third wave of infections that has strained the health-care system with critically ill patients. \u201cThe key is to get as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get these numbers down.\u201d Ontario is sending half its vaccine supply to designated COVID-19 hot spots for the next two weeks, and the government has said it hopes to allow all adults in the province to book shots by the end of the month."},

Once that individual is assessed on the phone and depending on the symptoms described, a nurse might refer them to a COVID-19 assessment centre for an in-person assessment. But now these individuals have another option: to go through a drive-thru COVID-19 testing site in Dartmouth, where they can get swabbed, have their temperature and blood pressure taken \u2014 all while remaining in their car. \u201cI think patients in their cars at the drive-thru feel less anxious,\u201d said Wendy Szabo, an NSHA nurse who works at the site located behind Dartmouth General Hospital. She said in the last five weeks she has been working at one of the COVID-19 assessment centres, and compared to the drive-thru testing site, which opened last Tuesday, patients tend to feel more nervous and anxious because of the unusual environment. Szabo also noted that in comparison with in-door testing sites, it is faster to do swabs at the drive-thru \u201cbecause the assessment form is very streamlined.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s much more contact that\u2019s happening in the indoor site because they\u2019re sitting with us and there\u2019s much more interviewing and assessment that is required,\u201d she said. Typically at the drive-thru nurses would assess between 20 and 45 people, while in a COVID-19 assessment centre 98 to 135 patients would get tested. \u201cI think the drive-thru testing site was another avenue for patients. First of all, because there are some individuals who may not go to one of their primary assessment clinics because some feel that going into the clinic itself or exposing themselves to other individuals where they\u2019re being tested may cause them to get sick,\u201d said Lynn Molloy, on-site manager for the drive-thru testing site. \u201cAnd so this is an opportunity for them to remain in their own space, there and get tested,\u201d she added. Moreover, she said the drive-thru requires less PPE gear because nurses aren\u2019t coming into contact with individuals as much. \u201cThere\u2019s a swab and the individuals drive out. Any indication from their assessment that they need some further direction, then we ask them to pull ahead to another tent and they will wait there with the nurse while she contacts the COVID-19 physician on-call to see there\u2019s any other follow-up,\u201d Molloy said. The assessment happens under a big tent and there are two lanes for cars and two lanes for the nurses to work out of. There is now a COVID clinic drive through at Dartmouth General Hospital    \u2014 Reynold Gregor (@reynoldgregor)  \u201cIf we\u2019re fully staffed and having a lot of volume, we would have four cars under the tent with four teams swabbing patients,\u201d said Molloy, adding that they didn\u2019t have the resources before to open the drive-thru testing site. She said that the tents and the whole design of the drive-thru was donated by a local business called Advantage Food Equipment, and that\u2019s what made it possible for the drive-thru to open up in the first place. Lynn said the volume of people coming through the drive-thru has lessened, but the teams are still working to make sure everyone who comes through the site gets tested.

Results from the final analysis of the UK trial were largely in line with interim data released in January. The company expects to use the data to submit for regulatory authorization in various countries. It is not clear when it will seek U.S. authorization or if regulators will require it to complete an ongoing trial in the United States. Novavax expects data from a 30,000-person trial in the United States and Mexico by early April. Dubovsky said that Novavax is still planning to file for authorization from UK regulators early in the second quarter of 2021. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The UK trial, which enrolled more than 15,000 people aged 18 to 84, assessed efficacy of the vaccine during a period with high transmission of the UK virus variant now circulating widely. The shot\u2019s effectiveness in the South Africa trial declined to around 49 per cent when the analysis included data from HIV-positive participants. The vaccine could be cleared for use in the United States as soon as May if U.S. regulators decide the UK data is enough to make a decision. It could take a couple months longer if they insist on first seeing data from the U.S. trial, its chief executive told Reuters earlier this month. \u201cUltimately, they have to decide whether the data we can bring to the table is adequate or whether they would prefer to wait on data from our U.S. study,\u201d Dubovsky said on Thursday. Novavax\u2019s vaccine production plants should all be fully functional by April, executives said on a March investor call. The drugmaker expects to have tens of millions of doses stockpiled and ready to ship in the United States when it receives authorization, CEO Stanley Erck told Reuters. Novavax plans to produce its two-shot vaccine at eight manufacturing locations, including the Serum Institute of India. If authorized, it would follow three COVID-19 vaccines previously approved for use in Canada and Britain from Pfizer and partner BioNTech, Moderna Inc and the AstraZeneca shot developed with Oxford University. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Canada has signed a   that states the company will provide 52 million doses of its vaccine candidate with an option to purchase 24 million more, and that deliveries will take place monthly to fulfill quarterly allotments \u2014 once it gets approved for use in Canada. Canada has inked a deal to  , but likely won\u2019t be able to begin manufacturing its own before the end of the year. The Maryland-based company has received $1.6 billion from the U.S. government in funding for the vaccine trial and to secure 100 million doses."},

With Canada\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine rollout beginning to pick up steam and more and more at-risk groups receiving their shot, University of Toronto Infectious Disease Specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch said that the fourth wave of the pandemic would most likely differ in demographics \u2014 with lower risk groups, like young people, getting infected at a higher rate than others. \u201cAs we have more and more people vaccinated, you know, we will see the demographic change of who\u2019s infected,\u201d said Bogoch. \u201cEventually we\u2019ll start to see a decoupling of cases and hospitalizations. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cYou may have a fourth wave that doesn\u2019t put the same stresses on the health care system. Having said that, we don\u2019t know what that\u2019s going to look like yet.\u201d The country\u2019s effort to get more jabs into the arms of people has picked up significantly over the past few weeks, however, with a total of 7.83 million doses administered as of April 12, according to Health Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a press conference Friday that the country still remains on track to get at least 44 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca by the end of June. The Trudeau government has also maintained an earlier promise that any Canadian adult who want a vaccine would be able to get one by September. Despite this, Canada for the first time eclipsed the U.S. in its rate of new cases of the virus on Friday. A Global  \u00a0shows that on Friday, Canada reported 205.73 new cases per million on a rolling seven-day average, relative to the country\u2019s population, while the United States sat at 205.12. That could spell trouble for Canadians as daily cases in the country reached an all-time high earlier this week at 9,255, with experts and public health officials sounding the alarm on the buckling capacities local ICUs are facing across the country. According to the country\u2019s chief public health officer, COVID-19 rates of infections and hospitalizations were also beginning to increasingly affect younger people \u2014 with figures showing a surge in hospitalizations for those between 40 to 59 years old. \u201cThese data also show that an increased number of adults in this age group were admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and received mechanical ventilation in March 2021,\u201d said Dr. Theresa Tam in a statement Sunday. The implications of the country\u2019s third wave, according to Bogoch, could also potentially seep into and cause complications for those infected from the fourth. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cSome young people can still land in hospital and you might not have the same level of health care system capacity because of how significant the third wave was,\u201d said Bogoch. Bogoch said that much like how the country\u2019s first three waves of the virus were handled, Canada needs to be ready to implement public health policies and measures in order to prepare for a potential fourth wave. \u201cHow quickly we come out of this third wave is completely dependent on policy,\u201d he said. \u2014\u00a0"},

Premier Doug Ford, Health Minister Christine Elliott and Ontario\u2019s chief medical officer of health Dr. David Williams revealed the long-awaited blueprint at Queen\u2019s Park on May 20. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through so much in the past 15 months \u2026 We\u2019re in a better place right now and that\u2019s a result of your commitment of keeping each other safe and getting vaccinated,\u201d Ford told reporters Thursday afternoon. \u201cPlease keep following the guidelines closely, stay vigilant, stay safe.\u201d Before the first phase begins, the Ontario government will permit outdoor recreational amenities (restrictions will be in place) to reopen as of 12:01 a.m. on May 22. A spokesperson for Premier Doug Ford told Global News the current stay-at-home order, along with its more than two dozen reasons for leaving home, will end on June 2 as previously confirmed. However, the lockdown restrictions imposed on a variety of sectors, including businesses, will remain until the first phase of the reopening plan begins. Phase one will begin as soon as 60 per cent of all eligible Ontario residents have received their first of two COVID-19 vaccine doses, which is estimated to begin around June 14 based on trends seen in mid-May. As of May 20, a spokesperson confirmed to Global News 58.5 per cent of adults received at least one dose. However, Elliott said the first phase entry date could change if there\u2019s a change in health indicators or vaccine uptake. The initial phase is primarily focused on resuming outdoor activities where there are small crowds. Here are the highlights of what\u2019s allowed under the first phase: \u2013 Outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people (a government spokesperson confirmed different households can mix) \u2013 Patios with up to four people at each table \u2013 Retail will begin reopening with a 15-per-cent cap for non-essential businesses, 25 per cent for essential retail \u2013 Outdoor religious ceremonies and rite with capacity limits and two-metre physical distancing requirements \u2013 Outdoor sports and training for up to 10 people allowed \u2013 Day camps, campgrounds, Ontario Parks, horse racing, speedways, outdoor pools, zoos, splash pads allowed A minimum of three weeks will need to pass and 70 per cent of all eligible Ontario residents will need to have their first COVID-19 vaccine dose and 20 per cent of residents will need to have the required two doses. At that point, here\u2019s what else will be allowed: \u2013 Outdoor gatherings for up to 25 people, indoor gatherings for up to 5 people \u2013 Outdoor patio tables will be able to have up to six people \u2013 Non-essential retail capacity will be increased to 25 per cent \u2013 Personal care settings with face masks worn at all times \u2013 Outdoor meeting and event spaces, amusement parks, water parks, boat tours, county fairs, sports leagues and events, cinemas and arts venues will be allowed to reopen After another three-week-minimum period, along with up to 80 per cent of residents receiving their first vaccine dose and 25 per cent receiving their second dose, more indoor activities will be allowed where masks can\u2019t always be worn. Here\u2019s what can operate under phase three: \u2013 Large indoor, outdoor gatherings and indoor dining \u2013 Greater expansion of capacity for retail businesses \u2013 Larger indoor religious services, rites and ceremonies \u2013 Indoor meeting, event spaces \u2013 Indoor sports, recreational facilities \u2013 Indoor seated events, attractions, cultural amenities \u2013 Casinos and bingo halls \u2013 Other outdoor, phase two activities will be allowed to operate indoors At the end of each phase, health system indicators will be reviewed before moving to the next step. Ford was asked about planning if there is a surge in cases, hospitalizations and/or deaths, but didn\u2019t immediately elaborate on if there\u2019s a plan in place. He encouraged everyone eligible to get a vaccine to do so. When it comes to schools, officials opted to keep students at home for remote learning. Ford said there wasn\u2019t consensus among scientific advisors about reopening schools. After the announcement about schools, a group of pediatric health-care providers and advisory groups, including the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and the Children\u2019s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, to call on the government to immediately reopen schools. The groups said with cases falling, it was time to recognize the detrimental impact the pandemic has had on children and allow them to return to the classroom. \u201cChildren and youth have suffered immeasurably over the course of the pandemic,\u201d they said. \u201cIt is time to prioritize their health and well-being.\u201d Ontario NDP Leader Andrea Horwath called the lack of a plan for schools \u201cshocking.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s shameful that the Doug Ford has left schools and kids out of the mix here,\u201d she said, adding Ford \u201cput them to the bottom of the list.\u201d Meanwhile, the president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business said his group was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d there wasn\u2019t an immediate reopening for some businesses. \u201cBusinesses deserve to know exactly when it\u2019s their time to finally reopen to customers and plan for rehiring employees, cleaning and sanitizing the premises, acquiring inventory, and other reopening activities,\u201d Dan Kelly said. The new guidelines were released a day after the Ontario Hospital Association wrote to Premier Doug Ford and pushed the government to ensure low-transmission environments (such as uncrowded parks, golf courses, playgrounds and tennis courts) are opened first, followed by crowded outdoor environments (patio dining) and uncrowded, well-ventilated indoor environments (such as retail), and ending with crowded indoor environments (such as restaurants and gyms). \u201cAs the third wave slowly eases, we are all looking forward to re-opening the province, but the speed and scope must be carefully considered. As you said last week, we simply can\u2019t rush to reopen. Ontarians must have confidence that the goal is to avoid a fourth wave and the subsequent need to reimpose provincewide restrictions, above all else.\u201d The association also pushed for maintaining current travel restrictions, setting vaccine targets for \u201cspecific, high-risk communities\u201d and keeping a close eye on hospital and health system capacity (such as using indicators like a decline in total hospitalizations, deaths and new hospitalizations per 100,000 residents, ICU admissions etc.).

Worse health outcomes for Black people have only been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, and more robust data is needed to fully understand how COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted Black people specifically, they said. Global News analyzed   alongside new data about which neighbourhoods in Canada\u2019s most populous city have the most coronavirus cases. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The analysis found a strong association between high coronavirus rates and low income, conditions of work, visible minority status and low levels of education. There was an even stronger association between neighbourhoods with a high number of coronavirus cases and those with a higher population of Black people. The findings for Toronto mirror similar findings for neighbourhoods in Montreal. Data   showed that immigrants, refugees and lower-income people live in the hardest-hit regions. And these demographic characteristics are not limited to Canada.   globally by COVID-19, has higher death rates in poorer neighbourhoods. Black and Hispanic people living in New York City are also twice as likely to die from the virus, compared to white people,  New data this month from the  , a Minnesota-based research and analysis firm, found that Black Americans are dying of COVID-19 at a rate that\u2019s three times higher than white people. Their analysis found that one in 2,000 Black people in the U.S. has died from the virus so far. In Canada, while Manitoba, Ontario and Toronto have committed to collecting data on how race has impacted racialized communities, that data hasn\u2019t been released yet. The federal Public Health Agency of Canada has discussed collecting the data, but  . It\u2019s crucial when examining Toronto neighbourhood data on coronavirus cases that it\u2019s understood why these disparities exist in the first place \u2014 which is systemic racism, said Dr. Onyenyechukwu Nnorom, a public health physician and assistant professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto. \u201cSpecific to the Black community there are so many layers of what we are experiencing, but it is all anchored in anti-Black racism,\u201d said Nnorom. \u201cFor us in Canada, it\u2019s very historical, tracing back to slavery that we had here in Canada. Anti-Black racism is embedded in our intuitions. So what Black communities are feeling is an amplification of what we were already experiencing.\u201d There are multiple layers and intersections of discrimination that all compound into a population facing worse health outcomes, she said. Global News\u2019 data analysis illustrates some of those layers. By looking at income levels, Global News found coronavirus infection rates in Toronto had a strong association with low-income neighbourhoods. \u00a0 Nnorom points to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has outlined factors that   in the country. One factor is living conditions, characterized by poorer neighbourhoods that have more densely packed housing where it may be hard to practise social distancing. It\u2019s more difficult to isolate more vulnerable family members or quarantine sick family members in smaller living quarters as well, the CDC notes. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cIt\u2019s not because people who are racialized enjoy living in a densely populated context; it\u2019s because poverty in this country is racialized,\u201d Nnorom said. This is because people who are Black, along with other visible minorities, may take on precarious work due to discrimination in the job market. A report released in February this year by Statistics Canada found that   found they were discriminated against in the hiring process, compared to six per cent of non-Black people. The study also found that young Black males were twice as likely as non-Black males to be unemployed, and not in an education or training program. \u201cYou end up taking on service industry jobs or you end up unemployed. But all of those contribute to living in situations where you can\u2019t socially or physically distance. It leads to some people feeling that they do need to put their lives at risk,\u201d Nnorom said. Black people may end up working front-line jobs where they are less valued and where they don\u2019t have adequate access to personal protective equipment like masks, she said. These communities also rely on early morning public transit to get to work on time, putting them further at risk. Neighbourhoods where many people said they were members of a visible minority had  . The strongest association Global\u2019s analysis could find was with people who identified as Black. Global\u2019s analysis also found links between coronavirus rates and work circumstances. Neighbourhoods with high numbers of workers with\u00a0 \u00a0and people who normally   and   have higher coronavirus rates. Very few people in Toronto\u2019s high-income midtown neighbourhoods   or  , as these maps show: There is also an association between coronavirus rates and the number of adults in a neighbourhood with  . Along with work conditions that put people in these neighbourhoods at risk, there are often underlying health conditions in Black communities that predispose them to dying, explained Nnorom. \u201cIt\u2019s not due to a genetic difference between Blacks and whites, it\u2019s due to the inequities that Black and racialized people experience, such that there\u2019s an extra stress from everyday racism that predisposes us to chronic conditions,\u201d she said. Anti-Black attitudes embedded in Canadian health care shut people out of the system and prevent them from getting the care they need, she said. A 2017 report called   in Toronto outlined the need for race-based data collection and the experiences Black people have in Ontario\u2019s health-care system. The report found that hospitals need to be continuously thinking about how to tackle health inequities and move to create policies that prevent discrimination in all areas of health care. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Another report from 2017 by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care describes   who went to the emergency room in pain and wasn\u2019t believed until he threw up on himself, and they found he had a massive blood clot. \u201cOne time I was yelling for help and they called security and security threatened to call the cops because I was irate about a lack of care,\u201d the man said in the report. Only people within these communities notice that these incidents are happening on a daily basis, said Nnorom. Higher unemployment rates and underemployment rates in Black communities across Canada also mean there are higher food insecurity rates in these communities, and that directly impacts physical health as well, said Paul Bailey, president of the Black Health Alliance, a charity focused on the health of Black Canadians. \u201cData has shown in the national context when you start to combine income, access to education, food security, that then leads to increased risk of certain types of chronic diseases, diabetes, cancer, et cetera\u2026.pre-COVID, this was already the context lots of advocates are working on,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you insert a pandemic it only exacerbates the existing conditions,\u201d he said. This data around neighbourhoods is confirming what is already well known \u2014 that infections like the coronavirus impact people who are the least healthy and are in poverty so are unable to protect themselves, said Kwame McKenzie, chief executive officer of the Wellesley Institute, a research and policy think tank that works to improve health equity in the Greater Toronto Area. \u201cThis data to me is exactly what you\u2019d expect. The reason I want the data now is to be able to see whether we have a response that makes a difference,\u201d he said. Knowing that these populations in specific neighbourhoods are being impacted is important, but there needs to be a strategy that\u2019s developed from this information to get rid of disparities, he said. While race-based data collection around the coronavirus is starting to happen, Canada is behind, and these initiatives should have begun when the pandemic started, said McKenzie. Governments should really sit down with vulnerable populations and ask them directly what they need to keep them safe, he explained. \u201cIt may be that we need new interventions because the old ones don\u2019t work. It may be that we tell people to social distance\u2026 but we have overcrowding in apartments. Then, we have to be thinking of what help we can give people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be doing that now.\u201d If some neighbourhoods are more at risk, then the entire city becomes more at risk, and this is why governments should be reaching out to these areas to support them, McKenzie said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cBut the first thing is to make sure we know what\u2019s going on, so testing, tracing and giving people the information, and then working with communities to produce real alternatives,\u201d he said. \u201cThese things are not expensive compared to lives being lost.\u201d Data needs to be collected, otherwise there\u2019s no way to understand the depth of the issues you\u2019re facing, said Bailey. \u201cNot addressing these things at the front end means that all of us are at increased risk,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the fact that it\u2019s an afterthought is egregious\u2026 let\u2019s collect this data in the appropriate ways where we can make specific connections between things and then adequately address that upfront so that when the second wave does hit, we\u2019re actually prepared for whatever emerges.\u201d \u00a0can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing \u2014 very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms,\u00a0 . To\u00a0 , experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out. In situations where you can\u2019t keep a safe distance from others, public health officials recommend the use of a non-medical face mask or covering to prevent spreading the respiratory droplets that can carry the virus.

Some of the most common complications associated with COVID-19 included pneumonia, respiratory failure, kidney failure and sepsis or systemic inflammation, according to the  , published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) on Tuesday. \u201cFor anyone that\u2019s thinking this is really not that serious a pathogen, have a read of that study,\u201d Kerry Bowman, a bioethicist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto, said. \u201cThe kinds of complications are significant and also, it\u2019s a fairly unpredictable pathogen,\u201d he told Global News. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t  \u2014 the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus \u2014 is also associated with other lung and cardiovascular conditions, such as blood clotting disorders and heart inflammation, the researchers said, although the overall risks from these are comparatively low. \u201cThe main contribution that I think the study provides is that for all these different complications, we\u2019re giving those actual risk estimates so that clinicians and patients, if they\u2019re concerned about a particular potential complication, they can actually get a sense of how likely it is for those to occur,\u201d William Murk, a medical student at the Jacobs School of Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, University of Buffalo, N.Y. and co-author of the study, told Global News. The study was based on an analysis of more than 70,000 people who had a coronavirus-related hospital visit between Mar. 1 and Apr. 30, 2020, in the U.S. Bowman said that while the analysis confirms what was already known about COVID-19, it just serves as a reminder of the severity of the disease at a time when people are beginning to get exhausted by lockdowns as well as for those who might be hesitant to take the vaccine in the weeks and months ahead. On Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said a select few Canadians could receive the   from American pharmaceutical company   as early as next week. \u00a0has authorized two drugs for treating COVID-19 \u2014\u00a0 \u00a0and\u00a0 \u00a0\u2014 while a   are also being used and experimented as part of clinical trials across the country. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t According to the World Health Organization (WHO), most people who catch the coronavirus develop mild symptoms and illness and recover without hospitalization. Symptoms can range from fever, sore throat, dry cough and tiredness to a loss of taste or smell, skin rash and breathing difficulties. Last month, a   in the Lancet medical journal found that people who contract the new\u00a0 \u00a0are most likely to be highly infectious for nine days after the onset of symptoms, reinforcing the need for self-isolation for at least 10 days. However, depending on the severity of the illness, patients may also experience long-term effects ranging from fatigue, shortness of breath to chest pain, depression, muscle pain and heart palpitations, according to the  . More than eight months since being put on a ventilator after suffering breathing difficulties and pneumonia, COVID-19 patient Tony Passarelli, is still on oxygen support through nasal tubes. As his condition deteriorated in April, doctors at Toronto General Hospital had to put Passarelli on the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine as a last resort. Now, the 52-year-old from Bolton, Ont., is on a slow path to recovery. My lungs are scarred pretty bad,\u201d Passarelli told Global News in  . \u201cThey\u2019re not sure if I\u2019m going to be on the oxygen permanently yet, but I\u2019m still sore in my legs and my arms.\u201d His wife Linda said: \u201cWe were informed it was going to be a very long recovery.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Since the virus was   last December, more than 67 million people have been infected worldwide as of Monday, according to a running tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. The global death toll now stands at over 1,540,000, with the United States, Brazil and India continuing to lead in both cases and deaths. The pandemic has already crippled economies, overwhelmed health-care systems and brought life to a grinding halt for much of the world. However, promising results of vaccine trials by frontrunners  ,   and   and the   by the United Kingdom last week have offered renewed hope."},

Several European nations are already discouraging its use among seniors, citing a lack of data. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t On Friday,   they had received extra trial data from   that supports their view that the   is effective in the elderly. When asked about the efficacy in older adults the day before, Canada\u2019s deputy chief public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo said that Health Canada will review the data as it becomes available.  that a primary analysis of its Phase 3 trials showed an overall efficacy rate of 76 per cent after the first dose and 82 per cent after the second. The company said that its adenoviral vector vaccine  . The two vaccines currently approved in Canada, the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccines, both have efficacy rates around 95 per cent. \u201cWe\u2019ve been spoiled, our expectations have been set at that really, really impossibly high level and everything else is a disappointment,\u201d said Dr. Alan Bernstein, CEO of CIFAR and member of the federal COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force. \u201cBut, you know, 75 per cent is pretty good in real life.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine was authorized for emergency use in the U.K.  , and in   early this year, before being approved for all adults by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) at the end of January. France, Sweden, Germany, Italy, and Poland have all issued recommendations stating the vaccine should be prioritized for adults under the age of 65, 60 \u2014 or even 55 in the case of Italy \u2014 according to   and  . In its decision, the EMA said most of the participants in AstraZeneca\u2019s trials were between 18 and 55 and it needed more results in older participants \u201cto provide a figure for how well the vaccine will work in this group\u201d but it went on to say that \u201c \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Director of geriatrics at Sinai Health System in Toronto, Dr. Samir Sinha, said his view is that Canadians should \u201cget the vaccine that you can get your hands on as soon as possible because as soon as most of us are vaccinated, the more community protection we have and the better off we\u2019re all going to be.\u201d Bernstein echoed those sentiments, adding \u201cthey all look very effective.\u201d He also explained that efficacy is just one factor \u2014 though a very important one \u2014 in deciding what makes a good vaccine. Vaccine effectiveness and vaccine efficacy are actually slightly different, as explained by Bernstein. Efficacy refers to the results from a controlled trial whereas effectiveness reflects how it performs in the \u201creal world,\u201d though both terms tend to be used interchangeably outside of academic settings. \u201cThe reason it\u2019s distinguished from a trial is trials are not in a sense \u2018real-life\u2019 in that the companies will choose volunteers that are healthy beforehand or try to choose volunteers that are healthy beforehand,\u201d he explained. He said it\u2019s not that companies are \u201cfudging the results\u201d but that they don\u2019t want results to be \u201cconfounded by people who are already very ill.\u201d So, how is efficacy determined? \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In Phase 3 of a vaccine trial, scientists compare the results from a group of people who\u2019ve received the vaccine to a group of people who have received a placebo. \u201cIf 100 people got infected in the non-vaccinated group, we then looked over to the vaccinated group. We say, \u2018OK, well, if all these people were circulating in the same community, there should be at least 100 people who could have gotten infected in the vaccinated group,'\u201d Sinha explained. \u201cAnd when we find out that only five actually got infected, it tells us then that that vaccine is 95 per cent effective.\u201d Sinha adds that 95 per cent effectiveness, for example, doesn\u2019t mean that 95 people out of 100 people are protected, but rather that \u201cit\u2019s up to 95 per cent effective in every one of us who gets that vaccine. We just don\u2019t know who might be the person, for example, who doesn\u2019t have that level of effectiveness.\u201d \u201cIf we give you the vaccine, can your body respond to that vaccine to give you the protection that you need to fight off COVID?\u201d The same weakened immune system that makes the elderly more susceptible to the virus is also what makes them less likely to have a robust response to vaccines. \u201cWe\u2019re all different genetically, which means we have different responses genetically in our immune system to insults like viruses. And some people overreact, some people underreact, and some people are in the sweet spot of reacting just right,\u201d Bernstein explained. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that different ethnic groups, that people of colour, will respond differently to the virus or to the vaccine or both. And that has not been studied that carefully actually, yet.\u201d While everyone\u2019s immune system is a little bit different, Sinha says typically young and healthy people have a \u201cgood, robust immune system.\u201d Age or illness, for example, can weaken the immune system. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The fact that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines appear to be as effective in older people as in younger people actually surprised Sinha. \u201cIt must be this mRNA technology that actually helps to boost the immune systems of older people in such a way that they get the same level of protection as younger people,\u201d he suggested. \u201cWhat we might see over time is other more traditional vaccine technologies, they may not be able to boost the immune system of older people or other more immunocompromised people to the same level.\u201d It\u2019s possible, Sinha says, that we may get to a point where health care professionals would select a vaccine based on how well a particular person is likely to respond to it. \u201cAnd right now, for my older patients, I would highly recommend they get the Moderna or Pfizer vaccination because they seem to be 95 per cent effective.\u201d Outside of efficacy in preventing illness, Bernstein says the two other properties that matter are how long protection lasts and what impact the vaccine has on transmission. \u201cSo let\u2019s say you have two vaccines, one\u2019s 70 and one\u2019s 90 per cent effective in the trials, but the one that\u2019s 70 per cent lasts for five years, the one that\u2019s 90 only lasts for six months,\u201d he said as a hypothetical example. \u201cWhich is a better vaccine?\u201d Sinha says that vaccines approved so far have been shown to significantly protect people from getting sick and dying but more data is needed to determine \u201cif it can actually prevent your ability to transmit the virus to another person.\u201d Data released earlier this week from AstraZeneca showed that the viral load \u201cin the body of people who were vaccinated is lower than in the placebo group,\u201d which Bernstein says would be \u201cconsistent but not proof that it may be transmission is lower from person to person.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In addition to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Bernstein expects that the AstraZeneca, Novavax, and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccines will be approved in Canada. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not meant to influence Health Canada because I can\u2019t. But that\u2019s my own view, looking at the data \u2014 and the regulators will see more data than we have seen, than I have seen. They\u2019ll see every little scrap of data,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere may be things there that are, you know, deal-killers. But I think based on what we know and what the companies have released, I would say that all three will be approved.\u201d"},

Alberta\u2019s daily new case counts hovered just below 1,000 over the Easter long weekend, with variant cases surging \u2013 going from roughly 100 a day three weeks ago to 676 new cases identified on Tuesday, according to Kenney. \u201cSo now, variants are pretty consistently over half of our new cases, over 40 per cent of our total active cases,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the race between variants and virus, the variants are winning.\u201d To curb the rising numbers, as of Friday at noon, indoor dining at restaurants will once again be off the table. Kenney said outdoor patios are still allowed to operate at restaurants and bars, and establishments can still offer take-out and delivery. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Social events will also be restricted, with indoor gatherings still being banned and outdoor gatherings\u00a0capped at 10 people. I am concerned about the rising cases, including variants, in our province. Please keep making safe choices and limit in-person interactions whenever possible to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 provincewide. (10/10) \u2014 Dr. Deena Hinshaw (@CMOH_Alberta)  As of midnight on Wednesday, retail stores will also see their capacity reduced once more to 15 per cent from 25 per cent, and group fitness activities have been banned again. One-on-one fitness with trainers is still allowed. Performance activities like dancing, singing, playing instruments and acting are also restricted for the time being. Libraries have also been closed \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d \u201cThese measures are designed to buy us time to get enough Albertans vaccinated so we can finally get through this thing,\u201d Kenney said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t All other existing public health restrictions are still in place. Essentially, the move returns Alberta to Step 1 of the province\u2019s  . Opposition NDP health critic David Shepherd said Kenney\u2019s renewed health restrictions are the right call, but once again came too late despite clear evidence of the looming danger of the variants. Shepherd said Kenney should have acted sooner on the variants and had financial supports ready to go for businesses that once again must close or scale back operations. \u201cWe could see it coming,\u201d said Shepherd. \u201cUnfortunately, we here in Alberta have a premier who acts last and acts least.\u201d When talking about the severity of the variants spreading, Kenney gave an example where one case of the P.1 variant brought into the province by someone returning from B.C., has led to 35 infections of the illness in Alberta. One person linked to that outbreak has died and two people were admitted to the ICU for treatment, he added. \u201cThese variants are a real enemy of public health and of lives,\u201d he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Kenney said as it stands, Alberta is on track to be reporting 2,000 daily infections by the end of the month, based on transmission that\u2019s happened to date. \u201cTo be blunt, this wave is here. These trends would threaten the maximum capacity of our health-care system by next month, right when we\u2019re reaching critical mass of vaccination,\u201d he said. The premier said he still believes that if Albertans adhere to the restrictions and do what they can to bring case counts down, the province can still have one of the best summers in Alberta\u2019s history, despite doubt from both the public and some in his caucus. Kenney said Health Minister Tyler Shandro will work with a committee of MLAs and health officials to bring Alberta \u201cback to normalcy as soon as safely possible,\u201d adding that he doesn\u2019t want to see restrictions in place any longer than is absolutely necessary. That committee is expected to present its report by the end of April. More than 734,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Alberta as of Tuesday, and Kenney said the province is averaging about 125,000 shots per week. The province has received almost 400,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines, which means the vaccine rollout can expand further, Kenney said, in hopes of slowing the spread of variants. As of Wednesday, all those who qualify for immunization as part of Phase 2B, anyone over the age of 16 with an underlying health condition, can book their appointment. \u201cMy immediately expanding Phase 2B\u2026 half a million more Albertans will become eligible for vaccines overnight,\u201d Kenney said. Albertans aged 55 to 64 who don\u2019t have underlying health conditions can also now book appointments to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine. The province is also opening seven \u201crapid flow-through\u201d clinics this week, aimed at speeding up the vaccine process, in Red Deer, Fort McMurray, Edmonton, Calgary, Grande Prairie, Lethbridge and Medicine Hat. The government will also allow walk-in immunizations at select pharmacies. More information on which pharmacies will take walk-ins is expected next week. The province is still on track to immunize each adult Albertan who wants a COVID-19 shot, provided adequate supply comes from the federal government. The premier projected that by summer, more than half of the province\u2019s population will be considered immune to COVID-19, whether through the vaccine or because they contracted the virus. By the end of June, Kenney said nearly two-thirds of the population will be considered immune, and he hopes that almost three-quarters of Albertans will \u201chave a good degree of immunity\u201d by September. Kenney said those milestones are part of the province\u2019s path to recovery, more details of which will be released later this month. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWhen about half of us have immunity, we\u2019ll be raising capacity limits, we\u2019ll be able to gather together in larger groups, some restrictions will remain, but not like now,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cOnce two-thirds of us have immunity, it will start to look like normal. There will be no formal restrictions, stampede and other festivals will be possible, masks and distancing will be part of our lives, but only encouraged. \u201cAnd then, once three-quarters of us are immune, we\u2019ll be fully back to normal, without masking, without isolation.\u201d Alberta reported 931 new COVID-19 infections on Tuesday, bringing the total active cases to 10,809 \u2014 which marks a 27 per cent jump in the last week, Kenney said. Hospitalizations rose to 328, with 76 people being treated in ICUs. Alberta Health reported three additional COVID-19 deaths on Tuesday, all of which included comorbidities. A man in his 90s and a woman in her 90s, whose cases were linked to the outbreak at the McKenzie Towne Care Centre in the Calgary zone, died. A woman in her 90s, also in the Calgary zone but whose case wasn\u2019t linked to an outbreak, also died. With these additional COVID-19-related deaths, Alberta\u2019s death toll from the disease surpassed 2,000 on Tuesday. Dr. Deena Hinshaw said because of a spike in cases in the Bow Valley, which includes three variant cases, Alberta Health Services is working with Lake Louise and Sunshine Village ski hills to do on-site and community testing of all staff and contractors. \u201cAt this stage of the investigation, there is no identified single event or cause for this increase in cases,\u201d she said. \u201cAt this time we are not recommending precautionary testing for anyone who has visited or skied in the Banff-Canmore area recently. However, if you are symptomatic \u2013 as we always advise \u2013 stay home, isolate and arrange for testing.\u201d"},
{"title": "\u2018Probable\u2019 Alberta COVID-19 model predicts 400-3,100 deaths: Kenney  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted April 7, 2020 7:24 pm", "body": "Under a probable scenario,   could claim between 400 to 3,100 Albertans\u2019 lives by the end of summer, Premier Jason Kenney announced in a televised address to the province on Tuesday night. He also said under this scenario, the province could see as many as 800,000 total infections in that time frame. The numbers are based on modelling done by Alberta Health around the   pandemic and the premier said officials also prepared a model for an \u201celevated scenario.\u201d \u201cUnder the more serious but less likely \u2018elevated scenario,\u2019 we would see infections peak at the beginning of May, with as many as one-million infections, and between 500 and 6,600 deaths,\u201d Kenney said in the stark address. Kenney noted that experts with whom his government has consulted project that if Alberta had no social distancing and public health orders in place, \u201cwe could experience as many as 1.6 million infections, and 32,000 deaths in Alberta \u2014 as many as 640 deaths per day.\u201d \u201cOur health system would collapse under the chaos of that scenario,\u201d the premier said. As of Tuesday evening, Alberta has seen 1,373 people test positive for COVID-19 \u2014 and 26 of those cases have resulted in fatalities. \u201cOur hearts go out to the loved ones of all of those lost,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cI will not sugar coat it,\u201d the premier told Albertans before revealing what the modelling has suggested could happen. \u201cYou need to know what we are up against.\u201d After disclosing the modelling completed by health officials, Kenney acknowledged that \u201cthese numbers can be overwhelming.\u201d \u201cBut these models are not a done deal,\u201d he noted. \u201cI want Albertans to see them as a challenge \u2014 perhaps the greatest challenge of our generation. \u201cThose numbers are not inevitable. How this actually plays out \u2014 how many people are infected, how many die, whether we overwhelm our health-care system \u2014 all of that depends on us and our choices.\u201d Kenney reminded Albertans about the importance of following public health rules and guidelines around handwashing, covering up coughs and sneezes, social distancing and practising self-isolation in cases where that is necessary. The premier also promised to \u201cspare no expense to prevent the spread, while providing the best possible care to those who need it.\u201d Following Kenney\u2019s speech, the premier\u2019s press secretary provided more context for the figures that health officials landed on when preparing COVID-19 models. \u201cThe numbers reported by countries are their detected cases who are tested or go to hospital,\u201d Christine Myatt said in an email. \u201cThese are the tip of the iceberg. Alberta\u2019s modelling estimates the total cases we may see in Alberta \u2014 total cases are the entire iceberg \u2014 both those that are tested and diagnosed, and those that have mild illness and would never be detected. In his address, Kenney acknowledged that Alberta\u2019s per capita number of recorded infections is second only to Quebec among Canadian provinces. \u201cBut that is in part because our brilliant scientists and lab technicians are conducting one the highest levels of COVID-19 testing in the world, so naturally we identify more positive cases,\u201d he said, adding that the rate of Alberta who are hospitalized or admitted into intensive care units because of COVID-19 is \u201cmuch lower than the other large provinces.\u201d \u201cHowever, those provinces saw their first cases before we did, so we might still catch up to their numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve probably heard about the curve of infections. That\u2019s the rate at which infections grow in a country or region. I\u2019m glad to report that the curve in Alberta is much lower than many other parts of the world. \u201cSo far, our curve more closely resembles countries that have successfully fought the virus, like South Korea, than the sharp upward rise seen in countries like Italy, Spain and the United States.\u201d Kenney reiterated, however, that things could get much worse if Albertans aren\u2019t consistent about following public health orders and recommendations. In his remarks to Albertans, Kenney said the novel coronavirus pandemic is just one of three crises facing the province, the other two being the staggering fall in global energy prices in recent weeks and the other being \u201cthe shutdown of much of the economy here and around the world, leading to a deep global recession.\u201d \u201cAll of this follows five years of economic fragility for our province,\u201d he said. \u201cFaced with this triple threat, our job is to save both lives and livelihoods. \u201cOur first priority is protecting the health of Albertans. At the same time, the huge damage to our economy \u2014 to livelihoods \u2014 is also having a real impact on the health and well-being of Albertans. \u201cWe cannot focus on either the pandemic or the economy. The two are intertwined.\u201d Kenney added that the more governments do right away to stop the pandemic, the more quickly economies can be restarted and economic recoveries can begin. The premier acknowledged the hardships facing Albertans and both small and large businesses. \u201cI want this to end as soon as you do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we simply cannot risk letting the virus loose in Alberta. That would create a public health catastrophe, which would force an even more stringent lockdown in the future, leaving our economy even further battered.\u201d Kenney said the measures are likely to stay in place at least until the end of May. \u201cAs hard as this will be, it is the only ethical choice when thousands of lives are still at stake.\u201d Kenney said his government plans to roll out its \u201cRelaunch Strategy\u201d once COVID-19 peaks in the province, calling it \u201cour plan gradually to open up our economy while preventing a second wave of the virus.\u201d He said the plan involves \u201can aggressive system of mass testing\u201d and using new tests that are being developed and approved to identify positive cases and those with immunity more quickly. \u201cOur plan is for Alberta to turn around as many as 20,000 tests a day. We are determined to continue leading the world in testing, the foundation of our Relaunch Strategy,\u201d he said. The plan also involves \u201cmore precise tracing of close contacts of those who are infected\u201d and \u201cstrong border screening.\u201d \u201cI believe it was a mistake for Canada to wait so long to close our borders, especially from countries with high levels of infection,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile Alberta does not control who can fly here, we will deploy a much more rigorous approach than the federal government has in screening and quarantining international arrivals. \u201cWe will strictly enforce quarantine orders to ensure compliance, including using technology like smart phone apps when appropriate.\u201d The plan will also see the government \u201cencourage and facilitate the use of masks in crowded public spaces, like mass transit.\u201d As for Alberta oil, Kenney said \u201cthere is a very real possibility that, as global inventories overflow, our energy will hit negative prices.\u201d \u201cI cannot overstate how grave the implications of this will be for jobs, the economy, and the financial security of Albertans,\u201d he said. \u201cMuch of this is due to the COVID-19 recession, but it has been made worse by a predatory price war led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, who are trying permanently to damage North America\u2019s energy industry. \u201cThat is why we have begun discussions with U.S. leaders about a co-ordinated defence of North American energy independence to protect us from the reckless actions of those regimes.\u201d Kenney added this is also why his government is investing in the Keystone XL pipeline. \u201cWe will do more, including a huge new investment in job-creating infrastructure projects,\u201d he said. \u201cTogether with a collapse in revenues, this will have an enormous impact on our province\u2019s finances. Alberta\u2019s budget deficit this year may triple from $7 billion to almost $20 billion. \u201cWe will face a great fiscal reckoning in the future.\u201d Kenney acknowledged the anxiety that many Albertans are currently feeling but told them that the province has strong institutions \u201cand a culture of resilience.\u201d \u201cMost importantly, we have each other,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will get through this storm, together. Thank you, and God bless Alberta.\u201d Opposition and NDP Leader Rachel Notley held a brief news conference at the Alberta legislature shortly after Kenney\u2019s address and said as troubling as the numbers may be, she wanted to reinforce some of the premier\u2019s more hopeful comments. \u201cOur ability to keep these numbers low is within our power and forms a shared responsibility for all Albertans,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cWe must follow the advice of public health officials.\u201d \u201cThis pandemic is hurting all of us,\u201d she said, adding she wants the government to ensure the most vulnerable Albertans are protected and that it \u201cspare no expense\u201d to address what she called a staffing crisis at seniors\u2019 centres. She called on the government to ensure front-line health-care workers have all the personal protective equipment they need and suggested that Kenney reopen the emergency support payment program that ended Monday. \u201cWe know this is beyond stressful,\u201d she said of Albertans who have lost their job or business during the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s incomparable.\u201d As for the government\u2019s plan to eventually restart the economy, Notley said she hopes any rebuild revolves around an economy that is \u201ctruly diversified.\u201d Dr. Craig Jenne, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Calgary, said increased testing could help future modelling accuracy. He noted that testing more Albertans will help limit the chances of a second wave of the virus. In analyzing Tuesday\u2019s projections, Jenne said the models show that Alberta has done well at flattening the curve to the point where Alberta\u2019s health-care system should be able to handle the peak of infection. \u201cIf we prevented a few infections in the early stages, that will result in tens of thousands of prevented infections in the later stages, and as a result, fewer deaths,\u201d he said."},

Testing will be conducted in both Terminal 1 and Terminal 3. The announcement comes as the federal government\u2019s regulations requiring incoming travellers to provide a negative PCR COVID-19 test within 72 hours comes into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Jan. 7. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The government said inbound international travellers can pre-register for the program or get tested when they arrive at the airport. Officials said anyone who participates will receive a free, self-collected lab-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and will be supervised by a health care provider either in-person or by video as the traveller self-administers the test. The test results will be reported within 48 hours and local public health units will follow up on any positive tests, the government said. Regardless if a person tests negative for the test at the airport, international travellers will still be required to self-isolate for 14 days as part of the federal mandatory quarantine. The Ontario government said this program at Pearson is in addition to the new federal government\u2019s pre-departure requirement for travellers bound to Canada to show proof of negative COVID-19 results from a test taken within three days prior to getting onboard their departure flight. \u201cThe province continues to work with the federal government to explore the next stage of the pilot, including a proposed modified quarantine period for participants who test negative,\u201d the province said. Premier Doug Ford said more than 60,000 international passengers come into Pearson every week. \u201cWe can\u2019t take any unnecessary risks,\u201d Ford said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re putting in place this new pilot program to help stop the spread of COVID-19 and respond to new threats like the recent strain of the virus we\u2019re seeing in an alarming number of countries without the same travel restrictions as the U.K.\u201d"},

Book now!    \u2014 Jason Kenney (@jkenney)  The government said in order to qualify, people must be over the age of 18, reside in Alberta at the time of the draw, and be able to provide proof of having received their shot before the draw. In the news release, Kenney said the lottery would help Alberta reach the 70 per cent benchmark, \u201cso we can open, and stay open.\u201d \u201cAlbertans have already responded in such a big way to our vaccine program and we\u2019ve been able to lift many health restrictions because of their efforts,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just need one final push so we can lift them all and get back to normal. If you\u2019ve been waiting to book, or you\u2019ve been looking for a reason get the shot, here it is.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t As of Saturday, 68.5 per cent of those eligible had received their first dose of vaccine, and 19.2 per cent of Albertans aged 12 and over were fully immunized with two doses. The premier\u2019s office said with 64,535 first-dose appointments booked in the next seven days, it\u2019s expected the province will reach the 70 per cent mark on June 18, starting the two-week countdown to Stage 3. In his video, Kenney said the draw for the first $1-million prize will be made on the day the province launches Stage 3 of the Open for Summer plan, \u201cto celebrate getting life back to normal.\u201d \u201cYou know that many places around the world have launched similar lotteries like this because we need to just nudge those who haven\u2019t gotten around to getting their vaccines yet,\u201d Kenney said in the video. \u201cAfter all, we\u2019ve had to spend billions of dollars in our health-care system and through supporting people through the past 16 tough months. So if we can just keep pushing up those numbers of people who are vaccinated, that will easily pay for itself in future savings by offering this Open for Summer lottery. \u201cSo please do your part.

We\u2019ve seen the government begin to move on that, but they waited until quite late in the game.\u201d Dr. Noel Gibney, a critical care physician and co-chair of the Edmonton Zone Medical Staff Association\u2019s pandemic response committee, said he thought it was a \u201cgreat idea.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time to get those last few individuals who are on the fence off the fence, and get them vaccinated,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing that I think will be very important is to see how does one become eligible? Do you have to actually register yourself? Or better still would be, I think, if you\u2019re simply vaccinated, that people can go onto the provincial database and be automatically registered\u2026 That would be the fairest. Otherwise I think a lot of older people may not be registered.\u201d The premier\u2019s office said details on how to register for the first lottery prize will be announced on Monday, June 14. The premier said more details will come in the days ahead on how to enter the lottery online, as well as the second and third $1-million draws to happen later in the summer. Gibney said he hopes the lottery is used as a tool to encourage second-dose vaccinations as well. \u201cI think the government is on the right track here, but I really think it\u2019s important they put as much effort into getting people their second doses as they\u2019re now putting appropriately into the first doses,\u201d he said. \u201cI really believe that is very important, particularly with this Delta variant\u2026 that everyone gets fully immunized with two shots.

The rules vary by region, as the province has left it up to each individual municipality to set their own regulations. Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health has said for months that she strongly recommends people wear masks when two metres of physical distance cannot be maintained. Dr. Deena Hinshaw said wearing a mask can help limit the spread of the  , and should be done alongside other health measures including good hand hygiene, physical distancing and staying home when sick. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Here\u2019s a look at the mandatory mask rules broken down by region: Effective Aug. 1, masks or face coverings became mandatory in all public indoor spaces, on public transit and vehicles for hire. This applies to all indoor public spaces such as retail stores, grocery stores, entertainment venues, recreation centres, restaurants and transit stations. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Face coverings can be removed when eating or drinking in a designated seating area, when taking part in a religious or spiritual ceremony or when engaged in water activities or physical exercise. The fine for breaking the   is $100, but the city says it will focus on education rather than enforcement. There are a number of exceptions to the bylaw, including those under the age of two, those who cannot put on and take off the mask without assistance and those with mental or physical concerns or limitations. Schools, hospitals and health-care facilities, child-care facilities and employee-only spaces where physical barriers have been installed between employees and patrons are also exempt. Calgary\u2019s   is similar to Edmonton\u2019s and mandates masks in all indoor public spaces and public vehicles, including on public transit. The bylaw took effect on Aug. 1. Shopping malls, entertainment facilities and taxis are all part of the new bylaw, however, private spaces such as schools, daycares and private residences are exempt from the mask mandate. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Those under the age of two, people with underlying medical conditions or disabilities inhibiting their ability to wear a face covering and people who are unable to place, use or remove a face covering safely without assistance are also exempt. The fine for breaking Calgary\u2019s bylaw is $50. \u200bBeginning Aug. 4, the City of Lethbridge required transit riders to wear face coverings in order to help limit the spread of COVID-19. On Aug. 24, Lethbridge city council passed a bylaw that will temporarily make face coverings mandatory in all indoor public spaces to help contain the spread of COVID-19. The bylaw states that a face covering must be worn at all times while in an indoor, enclosed or substantially enclosed public place or public vehicle, including malls, grocery stores, churches and taxis. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Banff\u2019s mandatory mask bylaw is perhaps the strictest in Alberta and includes a popular stretch of outdoor space. Effective July 31, everyone in the mountain town is required to wear a mask in all enclosed public spaces like shops, caf\u00e9s and facilities, as well as outside along downtown Banff\u2019s pedestrian zone. Two blocks of Banff Avenue \u2014 the town\u2019s main drag \u2014 have been closed to vehicle use since June to allow for physical distancing. This is the stretch where masks will be mandatory. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t There are some exceptions to Banff\u2019s mandatory mask bylaw, including children under the age of two, those with medical conditions that prevent safe masking and those who cannot put on or remove their mask without assistance. The fine for breaking Banff\u2019s bylaw is $150. A mandatory mask bylaw took effect in Canmore at noon on Friday, Aug. 7. The bylaw includes public transit, vehicles for hire (such as taxis and shuttles), public spaces (such as malls, retail businesses, churches and grocery stores) and Town of Canmore facilities (including the Civic Centre, Canmore Recreation Centre and Elevation Place). \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The Town of Canmore notes on its website that while the number of\u00a0 \u00a0cases in the mountain community remains very low, the number of active cases in Alberta is rising and there has been a \u201cnoticeable increase\u201d in visitors to the town since the launch of Stage 1 of\u00a0 . Following the Aug. 5 municipal council meeting, masks are now required on Jasper\u2019s downtown sidewalks, any public sidewalk where a two-metre distance can\u2019t be maintained and in all public indoor spaces. The bylaw\u00a0includes: Children under two, people who cannot wear a face covering due to a medical condition and people eating in restaurants while at assigned seating are exempt from the\u00a0bylaw.

On Aug. 17, Spruce Grove city council approved a temporary mandatory face coverings bylaw, which the city said may be implemented if or when the city reaches the active number of COVID-19 cases that would place it under a \u201cwatch\u201d status as determined by the Province of Alberta. Based on the current formula, the city said a \u201cwatch\u201d would mean 18 active cases, along with other factors. On Oct. 23, the face coverings bylaw went into effect at 9 a.m., making it mandatory for members of the public to wear a face covering or mask at all times while in an indoor, enclosed, or substantially enclosed public place or in a public vehicle. A list of exemptions is available  . Once the \u201cwatch\u201d designation is removed, the bylaw will remain active for another 30 days, the city said. In Strathcona County, east of Edmonton, face coverings were required to be worn on all transit vehicles and in county-owned facilities, effective Aug. 4. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Council also passed a bylaw in August that would see face coverings become mandatory in all indoor public spaces if the municipality reaches 25 active COVID-19 cases or more.

A number of exemptions are built into the bylaw to accommodate those who are unable to wear a face covering. On Aug. 10, Beaumont city council approved a bylaw requiring face coverings to be worn in \u201call publicly-accessible indoor places and public vehicles in order to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.\u201d The bylaw took effect on Aug. 14 and expires on Oct. 31 unless it is extended by city council. The bylaw requires people to wear face coverings in city buildings, retail stores, restaurants and most other indoor places that the public can access. Public vehicles include Beaumont Transit, taxis and ride-for-hire services like Uber. Some people will be exempt from the bylaw, including children under two, people with a medical condition or disability that prevents them from wearing a mask, people seated in a restaurant or bar, and people engaging in physical activity. The fine for violating the bylaw is $50 but the City of Beaumont says it is focusing on education instead of enforcement. On Aug. 7, Fort Saskatchewan city council approved a bylaw that requires people to wear face coverings in indoor public places if the municipality has 10 active COVID-19 cases at any time. Council also approved making face coverings mandatory inside all city buildings and facilities as of Aug. 10. The city said it will emphasize education \u201cuntil the practice becomes more routine.\u201d On Oct. 13, the city posted to its website that its face-covering bylaw was taking effect that day as the municipality reached 15 active cases of COVID-19.

The City of Airdrie has made a similar move to Cochrane. While councillors voted against a mandatory mask bylaw on July 28, the city said a bylaw would be triggered if the city enters an \u201c \u201d status or requires increased public health measures. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t According to Alberta Health, to date, there have been no areas ever moved to \u201cenhanced\u201d status. The Town of Okotoks passed a bylaw on Aug. 17 making masks mandatory in all indoor municipal spaces as of Aug. 24. On Oct. 26, when active COVID-19 cases reached 16, the bylaw made masks mandatory in all indoor public spaces in Okotoks. The bylaw includes restaurants, public vehicles like transit and taxis, entertainment establishments, retail stores, places of worship, gyms, studios, common areas of hotels, medical clinics and offices where the public has access. The bylaw will be in effect until actives cases are under 15 for 30 consecutive days. On Aug. 18, Edson town council gave three readings to a bylaw that would come into effect if certain thresholds are met. Masks or face coverings would become mandatory in Edson if the region reaches more than 10 active cases of COVID-19, a persistent spread of active cases occurs in the community, an outbreak occurs within local schools, or a persistent and active infection rate profile occurs in neighbouring communities such as Hinton, Whitecourt or Evansburg. \u201cIf those triggers are reached, it would move Edson into the Medium Risk category of the bylaw and facial coverings would become mandatory. Other measures would also be reviewed at that time,\u201d read a news release from the town on Aug. 19. On Aug. 20, Sturgeon County passed a bylaw mandating face coverings in the county\u2019s public spaces, as well as county facilities within the municipality of the Town of Morinville. The bylaw applies to all indoor or substantially enclosed indoor spaces that are available to the public, whether owned privately or by Sturgeon County. The bylaw also includes public vehicles such as taxis and shuttles. The county said the bylaw was in response to the area being moved into the province\u2019s \u201c \u201d status. On Oct. 13, councillors in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo voted 7-4 to pass a   that would see the requirement kick in if the area reaches 50 or more active COVID-19 cases. The RMWB also tweeted on Oct. 13 that face coverings are mandatory on public transit \u201cacross the region.\u201d On Oct. 26, face coverings became mandatory in all indoor public places. On that date, the region reached 51 active cases of COVID-19. The bylaw will remain in effect for a minimum of 30 days.

It also doesn\u2019t apply to anyone who is unable to use or remove a face covering without assistance, someone who is unable to wear a face covering due to mental or physical concern or limitation or protected ground under the Alberta Human Rights Act. The face coverings can also be removed by someone eating or drinking in a designated seating area or as part of a religious or spiritual ceremony. Taking part in water activities and physical exercise also exempts someone from wearing a face covering. The Town of Drumheller   on Nov. 23, the same day a state of local emergency was declared in response to rising COVID-19 case numbers in the province. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The mandate applied to all public indoor spaces, the town said. Red Deer city council voted to approve a bylaw on Nov. 23 requiring people in that city to wear face coverings in all public indoor spaces and in public vehicles. The bylaw takes effect on Nov. 30.  but that city council believes the temporary measure is \u201ccritical if we want local case numbers and hospitalization to remain flat.\u201d Children under nine and people with a disability are exempt from the rule. The fine for not wearing a face covering in the city will be $50 once the bylaw takes effect. For more information, click  . On Dec. 4, lawmakers in Lethbridge County voted to bring in a temporary mask bylaw. County officials said the bylaw would take effect immediately and people who don\u2019t follow the rules could be fined $100. Some people were exempted from the new bylaw: children under 10 years old and people with a medical condition or disability that \u201cinhibits their ability to safely wear a mask.\u201d On Dec. 4, a temporary bylaw requiring face coverings to be worn in Pincher Creek took effect. The bylaw was passed by town council in a vote earlier in the day and requires masks to be worn in indoor public places and public vehicles \u201ceven when physical distancing can be achieved, unless the person is separated from others by an installed screen, shield or other barrier.\u201d Some exemptions to the rule will be granted, including for people under two years old, people who are eating or drinking and people with medical conditions. Failure to wear a mask can result in a $100 fine."},

The findings also showed declining workplace productivity, with 27 per cent of supervisors reporting that their employees were less productive than in 2019. Overall, 36 per cent of survey respondents said they were concerned about a co-worker\u2019s mental health, the report showed. Paula Allen, Morneau Shepell\u2019s global leader and senior vice president of research and total well-being, said the prolonged uncertainty around the global health crisis is causing \u201cburnout\u201d in Canada\u2019s workforce. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t There hasn\u2019t been a clear end as we had all hoped, and we\u2019re feeling very emotionally drained,\u201d she told Global News in an interview. Financial problems and uncertainty caused by the pandemic have only added to the stress. The Canadian economy   toward the end of the year, growing at an annualized pace of 40.5 per cent, after its   on record. However, the economic restrictions and physical distancing measures have caused major disruptions to Canadian businesses.  were lost\u00a0in December, the first decline since April, according to Statistics Canada. \u00a0lockdowns, restrictions and physical distancing left more than half of Canadians feeling lonely or isolated, according to   conducted exclusively for Global News. Social interactions declined by a record 13 per cent last year, said Darrell Bricker, CEO of Ipsos. Amid a year of job losses, social isolation and travel restrictions,   in December found that 40 per cent of Canadians said they have faced mental health, addiction or alcohol issues in some form in 2020. For someone who has had a history of depression and several suicide attempts,   says his past mental health problems have actually helped him get through the pandemic. As a teenager growing up in a broken home in Nova Scotia, Henick had tried to jump off a bridge but was saved by a stranger who pulled him off the edge. The 33-year-old mental health advocate wrote about his struggles in a book titled  , published earlier this month. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t He advised people not to be afraid to speak up about their problems and show empathy toward others during this difficult time. \u201cPick up the phone, send a Facebook message, maybe even write an old-fashioned letter. It really could save a life,\u201d he told Global News. Since last year, 24 per cent of Canadians have considered leaving their current job due to their employer\u2019s response to COVID-19, according to Morneau Shepell\u2019s report. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Lorna Borenstein, founder of Grokker Inc. and author of the forthcoming book,  said employers need to make sure employees know that they are cared for. \u201cIf they don\u2019t, they will damage their business today and weaken results tomorrow,\u201d she told Global News. Since May last year, the government of Ontario has offered free internet-based mental health therapy   to help Ontarians, including front-line health care workers, experiencing anxiety and depression. This is part of the province\u2019s   for mental health and addictions services during COVID-19. Meanwhile, Quebec   that it was injecting $100 million into mental health services, including teams on the ground to work with \u201cvulnerable clientele\u201d and promote early intervention. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Allen said it was important to seek professional help if needed. Both McIntyre and Allen also offered other helpful tips for people working from home: \u201cWe can address malignant uncertainty by having deliberate implementation plans that are very well executed,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cThat would do a lot of good for the mental health of Canadians.\u201d"},

{"title": "Canada is holding back its 1-shot J&J COVID-19 vaccine. Here\u2019s what you need to know - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted May 2, 2021 9:44 pm", "body": "Quality concerns over Canada\u2019s batch of     vaccines have prompted the nation\u2019s health agency to withhold the shot\u2019s rollout just days before deployment to the nation\u2019s hardest-hit area. On Friday, Health Canada announced it is holding back the J&J vaccine, a one-shot dose that experts and health officials touted as crucial in stemming the spread of the virus amid a devastating third wave of the pandemic, after it was revealed that parts of the batch were made in the same Baltimore plant where millions of other doses meant for the U.S. market had spoiled. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In a statement, the agency said that a \u201cdrug substance\u201d that would undergo further processing to become the final J&J shot was made at the Emergency Biosolutions plant in Baltimore, and was later shipped to a separate location to be completed and then sent to Canada. The plant was previously cited by the   (FDA) for several violations, including cleaning and sterilization as well as the potential for cross-contamination. That agency has since ordered the plant to stop making more J&J vaccines until it addresses the violations and manufacturing errors, which resulted in 15 million of those doses being destroyed. Canadians wait eagerly for the 300,000 doses expected to roll out on Monday to hotspots across the country, with the leaders of some hotspots expressing disappointment over the vaccines\u2019 delay as cases in some provinces continue to hit record highs. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the J&J COVID-19 vaccine. Health Canada in its statement did not give a timeline on when the review of the vaccine batch would be completed. The agency, which is working with Janssen and the FDA on reviewing the batch, said the vaccines would only be released once it was \u201csatisfied\u201d that they met the department\u2019s health standards. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t University of Toronto Bioethicist Kerry Bowman also said that he and everyone else wouldn\u2019t really be able to give a timeline on when that review would be completed. According to him, news of Health Canada\u2019s pullback of the vaccine could also have another added consequence \u2014 vaccine hesitancy. Recent reports of rare adverse events, including that of bloodclotting, have arisen after patients took the AstraZeneca or J&J shot. Both Bowman and several other public health officials and experts have said that the reports have fueled vaccine hesitancy across the country, even after repeatedly voicing that such events still remain extremely rare. Bowman however said there were actually two ways someone could view the implications of Health Canada\u2019s stop to the vaccine. A person could either look at it as another potential problem with taking a vaccine \u2014 or see it in a way that Health Canada\u2019s system to safeguard and check the vaccines actually works. Bowman said that people would either likely interpret it as either more \u201ctrouble\u201d on the vaccine front, or the fact that Health Canada\u2019s system was protecting us. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cBut I think it will contribute to vaccine hesitancy because statistically, we know that there are many people that are vaccine hesitant. \u2026 But you know, I think for a lot of people, including me to some extent, it shows the system has some checks and balances and safeguards, and that\u2019s a very good thing.\u201d Results from Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Phase 3 trials in late January suggested that its vaccine reduced severe outcomes from contracting COVID-19 by 85 per cent and even prevented 100 per cent of virus-related hospitalization or death. In March, following the vaccine\u2019s approval by Health Canada, the agency\u2019s chief medical advisor Supriya Sharma said that nearly 20 per cent of the participants in the clinical trials were 65 or older, and that there were also no differences in safety or efficacy compared to younger groups. The shot was 72 per cent effective in preventing COVID-19 infections after four weeks in J&J\u2019s U.S. trials, though that efficacy lowered to a 66 per cent average from other global trials \u2014 including a South African review that included a more transmissible variant. In comparison, Pfizer and Moderna had results of 95 per cent efficacy in their respective trials but had been tested against the virus\u2019 previous iteration and not against the increasingly prevalent and more infectious strains circulating today. Health experts have since warned against comparing or \u201cshopping\u201d for vaccines, maintaining their stance that the best vaccine was the first one that was going into your arm. Though not necessarily a factor in how effective the J&J shot is in preventing severe outcomes, the vaccine tenders a huge edge over others in it being able to be transported much easier \u2014 needing only to be kept in a refrigerator between 2 C and 8 C for at least three months. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Pfizer, on the other hand, needs to be stored at -70 C and Moderna between -25 C and -15 C. AstraZeneca\u2019s storage temperature is also the same as J&J\u2019s, at between 2 C and 8 C. The makeup of the J&J vaccine was also different than the mRNA used in Pfizer and Moderna. Using a non-replicating viral vector, similar to that of AstraZeneca\u2019s, the shot uses a harmless virus that can\u2019t copy itself \u2014 instead using it as a vector to tell our cells what they need to do to make COVID-19\u2019s spike protein. The immune system then recognizes the protein and then makes antibodies, then allowing someone\u2019s body to fend off an attack if exposed to the virus again. A new report published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has since found that only three per cent of the 13,725 incidents reported through the health agency\u2019s Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System after receiving the J&J vaccine were classified as serious. According to the CDC, by April 21, a total of 17 blood clot incidents in patients who also experienced low blood platelet levels were found out of the almost eight million inoculations. Fourteen of those blood clot reactions were found in the brain\u2019s venous sinuses, and three were found elsewhere in the body among women who were aged younger than 60. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The review, released Friday, said that the overall \u201csafety profile\u201d of the vaccine was similar to what was seen in its clinical trials. \u201cA rare but serious adverse event occurring primarily in women, blood clots in large vessels accompanied by a low platelet count, was rapidly detected by the U.S. vaccine safety monitoring system,\u201d researchers wrote in the report. \u201cMonitoring for common and rare adverse events after receipt of all COVID-19 vaccines, including the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, is continuing.\u201d The agency\u2019s report also included 88 deaths reported after taking the vaccine, of which three had occurred in patients with \u201ccerebral venous sinus thrombosis,\u201d but noted that none of the other deaths appeared \u201cto have an association with vaccination.\u201d On Monday, Health Canada updated the J&J COVID-19 vaccine product label to include a \u201cvery rare\u201d risk of bloodclotting. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve got three out of four vaccines that have had issues \u2026 but I personally would not be surprised if it\u2019s just a matter of time until all of them have issues, because once you roll these things out over millions of people \u2014 I think that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Bowman said. Though the rest of Canada\u2019s 10 million pre-ordered doses are coming at a later date, the 300,000 that arrived in Canada in late April also come at a time when several million more vaccines from other companies like Pfizer and Moderna were set to arrive in the coming weeks \u2014 raising the question of how best to use J&J\u2019s dose. Public health officials and experts have looked forward to the deployment of the Janssen shot in order to reach areas or groups of people that might face barriers in receiving a second dose. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Infectious disease expert Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti told the Canadian Press in April that the vaccine\u2019s mobility would be instrumental in being able to deliver it to more targeted populations. \u201cYou can transport the vaccine there and just boom, boom, boom, get it into people\u2019s arms,\u201d he said, noting that such a vaccine could be used in large, mobile vaccine clinics to inoculate hard-hit communities and essential workers. \u201cThe timing doesn\u2019t help \u2014 we really wanted to start (vaccinating) essential workers as quickly as possible. \u2026 But it\u2019s something you can do (easily) with J&J.\u201d In a previous interview with Global News, infectious disease specialist Dr. Isaac Bogoch said that the vaccine \u201celiminates barriers that might prevent people from coming back for a second vaccination.\u201d \u201cWe know there are some populations that will have more challenges \u2014 through no fault of their own \u2014 for coming back for a second dose, like populations in prison, populations in shelters, migrant farmworkers. They would all be ideal candidates,\u201d Bogoch said. Experts have also touted that a one-shot vaccine could open the door for at-home vaccinations for frontline health workers to reach people at home, like the elderly population who might be immobile. Yet despite its benefits, public health units won\u2019t see this vaccine as soon as hoped \u2014 even as a third wave grips Canada, filling ICUs and setting daily case records. \u201cMy understanding is Johnson and Johnson particularly was earmarked for hotspot areas \u2014 several that I noticed in western Canada \u2014 and it just slows all that down because the plan for Monday was for many places to really throw themselves into the J&J rollout in these hotspot areas, all of which is now on hold,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cIt\u2019s another delay for Canada.\u201d \u2014 w"},
{"title": "COVID-19 refunds: What to know about credit card chargebacks - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted June 4, 2020 5:00 am", "body": "With restrictions tied to the novel   pandemic likely to unravel all kinds of summer plans, consumers are scrambling to recoup money paid for cancelled flights, trips, weddings and children\u2019s camps, to name a few. Some are resorting to chargebacks, asking their credit card company to reverse payment for services merchants are no longer able to provide. But how do chargebacks work and when are you actually entitled to demand your money back? There are three main layers of laws and rules surrounding chargebacks, says Omar Ha-Redeye, executive director of the Durham Community Legal Clinic in Oshawa, Ont. The first is the contract between you and the merchant. The second is your credit card agreement. The third are statutes and regulations specific to certain industries as well as your province\u2019s Frustrated Contract Act, which spells out what should happen when a contract becomes impossible to uphold due to circumstances outside the control of the parties to the agreement. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The first step is to take a look at what exactly you agreed to with your vendor, Ha-Redeye suggests. The terms of service may contain a cancellation clause that sets out when and how you are entitled to your money back. Following the merchant\u2019s refund policy \u201c might be the quickest, cheapest way to get out of a financial commitment,\u201d Ha-Redeye says. If you didn\u2019t sign a proper contract, it\u2019s a good idea to have a written record of any promises the vendor may have made about returning your money. For example, if a business promises full refunds for cancelled reservations on its website \u2014 a practice that\u2019s becoming increasingly common as companies try to entice consumers in a highly uncertain climate \u2014 \u201cI would take a screenshot,\u201d says Ha-Redeye. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Don\u2019t be discouraged if you see a clause about \u201cforce majeure\u201d or \u201cact of God\u201d that accounts for extraordinary events that may prevent a service provider from completing a contract. It\u2019s not clear yet how \u201cforce majeure\u201d clauses will play out in the context of the   pandemic, Ha-Redeye says. But the mere presence of such a provision in a contract doesn\u2019t necessarily preclude the possibility of getting your money back, he adds. This may be especially true if you\u2019ve made your reservation before the restrictions linked to the health emergency went into effect, says Mikael Castaldo, credit cards manager at financial products comparisons site  . In general, if you and the merchant can\u2019t agree on a refund, a credit card chargeback becomes an option,\u00a0 Ha-Redeye and Castaldo say. The idea is to challenge a charge for an item or service you did not actually receive. You\u2019ll need to provide the details of the dispute, including the date and amount of the transaction, as well as proof that you\u2019ve already tried to resolve the issue directly with the vendor, Ha-Redeye says. Your credit card company will often tell you exactly what kind of evidence it needs, Castaldo adds. This is likely to include any relevant email exchanges between you and the merchant or some kind of documentation of phone conversations. That\u2019s why Castaldo advises taking notes when you call a merchant to ask for a refund. Note the date and time of the call, who you spoke to and what was said, he says. Don\u2019t despair if you\u2019re just left on hold and can\u2019t get through to a human being, Ha-Redeye says. A cell phone record showing multiple calls to a vendor is also proof that you\u2019ve made an honest effort to resolve the matter on your own, he adds. Once you\u2019ve submitted your evidence to your credit card provider, you can expect to hear back on your claim within 30 to 120 days, according to Castaldo. For amounts under $100, your credit card company may decide to refund you quickly \u2014 usually within two to five business days \u2014 even if it hasn\u2019t concluded its investigation with the vendor, he says. For larger amounts, however, expect the opposite. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In general, Castaldo adds, the larger the amount you\u2019re disputing, the bigger burden of proof you\u2019ll face to demonstrate that you are, in fact, entitled to a refund. It doesn\u2019t matter, however, whether you have already paid off the charge you\u2019re disputing, Castaldo says. If you have and your credit card provider concludes your claim has merit, you\u2019ll get the funds back. If you haven\u2019t, your credit card company may freeze any interest accruing on that balance until it has completed its investigation, he adds. If the claim is approved, you won\u2019t have to pay the charge. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t If you used your credit card points to pay, you likely won\u2019t get them back, Castaldo says. Instead, expect to get the funds back as an amount credited on your statement. It\u2019s important to act quickly once you\u2019ve determined you can\u2019t obtain a refund directly from the merchant, Castaldo adds. \u201cTry and apply within 30 days from the date of the charge,\u201d he says. However, if you\u2019re claiming a refund for a product or service you have yet to receive, it\u2019s acceptable to ask for a chargeback within 30 days of the original delivery date. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In other words, if you, say, booked a flight in October but weren\u2019t supposed to fly until mid-May, you\u2019re OK to ask for your money back within a month of your flight date, Castaldo explains. Your credit card agreement may specify a time window for disputing a charge. But even if you miss it, keep in mind that credit card providers have \u201ca vested interest in trying to find practical solutions and resolutions, especially in light of the pandemic,\u201d Ha-Redeye says. \u201cMaybe they can reverse this particular charge, and then they\u2019ll make money in years when you continue to use their service,\u201d he notes. Ha-Redeye also advises consumers to take a look at any relevant federal or provincial statutes and regulations when making their case to the credit card company. \u00a0 When it comes to flights, air passenger rights advocate Gabor Lukacs says even Canadians with non-refundable flights are entitled to refunds if the airline cancelled their trip. \u201cThere is a misconception about \u2018non-refundable\u2019 tickets,\u201d Lukacs told Global News via email. For consumers making their case to credit card companies, Lukacs recommends focusing on the concept of \u201cservices not received.\u201d Consumers may also want to look at airlines\u2019 tariffs for evidence of a contractual obligation to provide refunds. Lukacs refutes the notion that travel credit or vouchers, instead of a refund, constitute adequate compensation for passengers. \u201cYou paid for a ticket, not a gift card,\u201d he says. While there are no guarantees, it\u2019s \u201cvery possible\u201d that a small claims court would side with a consumer arguing they\u2019re entitled to a refund for a flight cancelled due to COVID-19 with, Ha-Redeye says. In general, consumers can also reference their province\u2019s frustrated contracts, he adds. \u201cThere are provisions in there that explicitly provide for a basis to get your money back,\u201d Ha-Redeye says. \u201cAnd I would encourage people to have a copy of that when they actually call their credit card company.\u201d While the statutes are slightly different from province to province, the concept is that  if a contract was frustrated by events or circumstances entirely outside of the parties\u2019 control, it should be reversed, Ha-Redeye says. If you aren\u2019t successful in obtaining a chargeback, the last resort would be to pursue a refund through small claims court, he adds. But ompanies, including the vendors as well as the credit card companies, don\u2019t want a lot of litigation after the pandemic is over.\u201d And that, Ha-Redeye believes, could ultimately play in consumers\u2019 favour. \u00a0"},

People who suddenly experience hair loss are \u201cvery disturbed\u201d by it, Carroll said. \u201cWe get a lot of panicked phone calls or texts to the office because their fear is, when it starts to happen, then they\u2019re going to lose all of their hair. And I think for a lot of people hair is an important part of confidence and how you present yourself to the world.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Dr. Jeff Donovan, a hair loss specialist in Whistler, B.C., and president of the Canadian Hair Loss Foundation, also says he\u2019s seen some cases in his clinic, though he\u2019s not sure how common this is overall. \u201cCertainly we are realizing now that it is part of the spectrum of conditions, but we don\u2019t yet have the numbers.\u201d The problem patients are reporting is called telogen effluvium, Carroll said. It\u2019s a well-known condition that is often a reaction to a high-stress situation, whether it be severe illness, or even strong emotional stress. It generally causes an overall thinning of hair all over the scalp, rather than bald patches, she said. \u201cYour hair is always in different phases,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s in a growing phase, a resting phase and finally a dropping-out phase. Luckily for most people, about 80 per cent of our hair lives in that growing phase. But when you have a stress on your body, there can be a shift and a higher percentage of the hair goes into the dropping-out phase.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cIt is almost like a safety measure in some ways,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cWhat we find whenever there is a stress on the body, or an illness, or weight loss, or viral infections, is a large proportion of the hairs on the scalp say, \u2018You know what, it\u2019s time to fall out. We can\u2019t dedicate all our resources right now to growing these hairs. We\u2019ve got to focus on other parts of the body, making sure they\u2019re doing well. The heart, lungs, liver, the kidneys. And we\u2019re going to devote our resources elsewhere and we\u2019re going to shed these hairs.\u2019\u201d It doesn\u2019t fall out all at once though, Donovan said. The hair generally remains in place for roughly three months before dropping. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Tying this kind of hair loss specifically to the SARS-CoV-2 virus is tricky though, he said, as many things could cause increased \u201cshedding\u201d of hair. Hair loss was reported among  , he said. High fevers and other severe symptoms seem to contribute to developing the condition. But the emotional stress of living through a pandemic can take a toll too, even among people who had mild symptoms of COVID-19, he said, or even people who haven\u2019t had the disease at all. \u201cIt\u2019s a very stressful time right now, and we\u2019re seeing rates of shedding like we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d While Carroll believes that this phenomenon is due mostly to stress, Donovan thinks it may also be directly tied to the virus. \u201cI think it would be a mistake to say that these people are shedding simply because of stress. This is a complex virus. It does many things to every organ in the body that we don\u2019t yet understand.\u201d There\u2019s good news though, both Carroll and Donovan say: the hair will probably grow back. \u201cSay you have a shedding phase of about four to six weeks,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cThen, the hair will start to repopulate.\u201d If you have shoulder-length hair or longer, though, it will be a while before the new hairs catch up, she said. \u201cThe prognosis is good for a lot of people,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cThe recommendation for most is just to see through it and just continue without formally treating it. Patients always want to do something. But the reality is this is self-resolving by definition.\u201d There are treatments available for particularly bad or prolonged cases, he said, like Minoxidil \u2014 commonly known by the brand name Rogaine. Seeing your hair fall out is alarming, Donovan said, but for this condition it is probably not permanent. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to understand that eventually this will stop. And it\u2019s unfortunately a long process, but it does resolve in most.\u201d"},

The military commander handling logistics for Canada\u2019s vaccine distribution program says there will be enough vaccine delivered to give a first dose before Canada Day to every adult who wants one. Maj.-Gen. Dany Fortin says that\u2019s if provinces follow the advice to delay second doses up to four months. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t He also cautions that it is dependent on having no production delays again. Health Canada anticipates a total of 36.5 million doses from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and the AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute of India by June 30. There are approximately 31 million Canadians over 16, and no vaccines are approved for anyone younger than 16. Here\u2019s a list of the inoculation plans throughout Canada: Health officials say vaccinations will begin this week for first responders. They say pre-registration for COVID-19 vaccines has opened for people aged 70 or older and for home-support workers. Newfoundland and Labrador announced March 3 it was extending the interval between the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to four months. Public health officials said the change will help them vaccinate 40,000 more people with a single dose by the end of March. Liberal Leader and incumbent Premier Andrew Furey said the decision is a game changer for the province\u2019s vaccination prospects. \u2014 Health officials say people aged 60 to 62 became eligible to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine starting March 18. Nova Scotia plans to have vaccine available to at least 75 per cent of the population by the end of September 2021. The province is planning to use mobile van clinics to vaccinate about 900 people who work at or use homeless shelters in the Halifax area. Public health is partnering with pharmacists and doctors to provide the vaccines at 25 locations. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Nova Scotia, meanwhile, has added front-line police officers to the list of people eligible for vaccination during the second phase of the province\u2019s rollout plan, joining groups such as long-haul truck drivers and hospital workers over the age of 60. \u2014 Health officials in Prince Edward Island say they will shift their focus to getting a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine to all adults by July 1, even if it means delaying the second shot for some. The province is offering the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine people ages 18 to 29 who work in gas stations and convenience or grocery stores. The announcement on March 16 came after the province opened AstraZeneca vaccination appointments a week earlier to young people in the food and beverage sector. \u2014 Health officials announced March 18 that people 80 and older, health-care professionals who have close contact with patients, and people with complex medical conditions are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. People 80 and over, a caregiver or a family member acting on their behalf can make an appointment for a vaccine at a pharmacy. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The province says all residents of long-term care homes have been offered at least one dose of vaccine. On Friday, March 19, all residents of First Nations communities who are aged 16 or older will have access to their first dose of vaccine. \u2014 Quebec started vaccinating older seniors on March 1 after a first phase that focused largely on health-care workers, remote communities and long-term care. In Montreal, mass vaccine sites, including the Olympic Stadium, opened their doors to the public as the province began inoculating seniors who live in the hard-hit city. COVID-19 vaccination appointments opened March 10 for residents 70 and older across Quebec. The minimum age is currently wet at 65 in three regions: Montreal, Abitibi-Temiscamingue and Cote-Nord. Premier Francois Legault says his government\u2019s goal is for all adult Quebecers who want a COVID-19 vaccine to get at least one dose by the province\u2019s Fete nationale on June 24. He also said the province\u2019s vaccination campaign will allow all Quebecers aged 65 and over to be vaccinated with one dose by mid-April. Quebec, meanwhile, is looking to enlist between 20 and 50 companies across the province to operate vaccination hubs to help accelerate its immunization campaign for people under 60. Health Minister Christian Dube says he\u2019s hoping the companies can administer a total of one million vaccines. To be part of the program, companies must commit to vaccinating between 15,000 and 25,000 people over a 12-week period between May and August. Quebec will provide the vaccines and necessary equipment and run the online appointment portal. The program will begin when residents under the age of 60 become eligible to be vaccinated, with a goal of fully vaccinating 500,000 Quebecers. \u2014 Ontario launched its COVID-19 vaccine booking portal and call centre on March 15. People aged 80 and older were the first eligible to use the system. Starting March 22, people age 75 and older will be able to make appointments through the booking system. Ontario focused its initial vaccine effort on those in long-term care, high-risk retirement home residents, some health-care workers and people who live in congregate care settings. It has said the rollout will look different in each of its 34 public health units. Some public health units are ahead of the province\u2019s schedule for vaccinations. A pilot project at more than 300 pharmacies in Toronto, Kingston and Windsor Oxford-AstraZeneca started offering shots to those aged 60 to 64 in March. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t That program is being expanded to offer shots to people aged 60 and older starting on March 22. Some primary care physicians are also offering Oxford-AstraZeneca shots to eligible patients in that age range. The pharmacy pilot will expand to 700 locations across the province in the coming weeks, then to approximately 1,500 sites as supply becomes available. Other currently eligible people include frontline health-care workers, Indigenous adults and chronic home health-care recipients, and some health units have started vaccinating people experiencing homelessness. The interval between vaccine doses has been extended to four months in Ontario. \u2014 Manitoba is starting to vaccinate residents aged 71 and older and First Nations people aged 51 and older. Health officials plan to reduce the age minimum, bit by bit, over the coming months. Specific groups of people, such as health-care workers and those who work in congregate living facilities, are also able to get vaccinated. The province is also giving the AstraZeneca vaccine to certain people with high-risk health conditions. Those eligible are First Nations people aged 30-64 and others aged 50-64. Dr. Joss Reimer, medical lead of the province\u2019s vaccine task force, has said inoculations could be open to all adults in the province by August if supplies are steady. There are supersites in cities where people can get vaccines and pop-up clinics have begun in rural and northern Manitoba communities for eligible residents. Manitoba has already indicated it would opt for a four-month interval between doses. \u2014 The Saskatchewan Health Authority is booking vaccinations for residents aged 70 and older. The minimum age drops to 50 for people living in the far north. A vaccine drive-thru clinic has also opened in Regina for residents who are 60 to 64 and some health-care workers. The province plans to expand its mass vaccination campaign in April. Saskatchewan will immunize the general population in 10-year increments, starting with those 60 to 69. Also included in this age group will be people living in emergency shelters, individuals with intellectual disabilities in care homes and people who are medically vulnerable. Premier Scott Moe says people will get their second shot of vaccine four months after the first to increase the number of people who can receive an initial dose. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Police, corrections staff and teachers are among the front-line workers not prioritized for early access to shots. The government says supply is scarce. \u2014 Health Minister Tyler Shandro has said the province expects to offer all Albertans aged 18 and over a first dose of vaccine by the end of June. On March 15, residents aged 65 to 74, and First Nations, Inuit and Metis aged 50-plus, were allowed to begin booking. The province had originally not expected to begin this stage of vaccination until April. In April, the\u00a0Alberta\u00a0government aims to start offering the vaccine to people with some chronic health conditions born between 1957 and 2005. That includes people with certain lung, kidney, liver and heart diseases, people treated for cancer in the past year, those with severe mental illness and substance use disorders, and pregnant women. After that, vaccines will be available to more health-care workers and people with jobs in certain congregate living settings, such as jails and homeless shelters. Meat plant workers will also qualify in this phase. Alberta\u00a0has also said it will follow other provinces by extending the time between the first dose and the second to four months. \u2014 More than 300,000 front-line workers will now be eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations in the coming weeks. The government says grocery workers, police, firefighters, teachers, postal employees and other front-line staff are considered priority groups and will be eligible to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The highest-risk work categories were identified by a task force last November and include sites where poultry, fruit and fish are processed, as well as large industrial camps. The province\u2019s age-based vaccination plan is ahead of schedule. Anyone 80 and up can arrange their vaccination by the end of the week. The province also opened vaccination clinics across B.C. on March 15 for Indigenous elders and seniors over 90 who had appointments. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Clinics also began in Prince Rupert and Port Edward, where all adults are being immunized regardless of age, because of high infection rates in the northwestern region of the province. The government has also extended the time between the first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccines to four months so all adults could get their initial shot by the end of July. \u2014 Nunavut\u2019s priority populations are being vaccinated first. They include residents of shelters, people aged 60 years and up, staff and inmates at correctional facilities, first responders and front-line health-care staff. After a COVID-19 vaccine is administered, patients will be tracked to ensure they are properly notified to receive their second dose. \u2014 The Northwest Territories says it expects to finish its vaccine rollout by the end of April. It also expects to receive enough doses of the Moderna vaccine by the end of March to inoculate 75 per cent of the adult population. \u2014 Yukon says it will receive enough vaccine to immunize 75 per cent of its adult population by the end of March. Priority for vaccinations has been given to residents and staff in long-term care homes, group homes and shelters, as well as health-care workers and personal support workers. People over the age of 80 who are not living in long-term care, and those living in rural and remote communities, including Indigenous Peoples, are also on the priority list for shots."},

And that saved his life, his wife says. \u201cWe were ecstatic because we went from absolutely no hope to now that there was hope of him hopefully continuing to fight this virus,\u201d\u00a0Linda told Global News. The ECMO machine pumps oxygen into the bloodstream through plastic tubes and is being used to treat COVID-19 patients in extremely critical conditions, who are unable to oxygenate their own blood, in intensive care units (ICU). In less severe cases, however,   has authorized two drugs for treating COVID-19 \u2014   and   \u2014 while a number of other therapeutics are also being used and experimented as part of clinical trials across the country. Here are some of the various therapies that are available in Canada. , an anti-inflammatory steroid, given orally or intravenously, has   for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in intensive care units across the country. It is a widely available and cheap drug that has long been used to treat other conditions like cancer, arthritis, asthma, blood disorders and inflammatory diseases. It has now shown to be effective in treating COVID-19. In June, a clinical trial of more than 2,000 in the United Kingdom found that the drug reduced the death rate by about one-third in coronavirus patients who required ventilation and one-fifth in those who required supplemental oxygen. The researchers found no effect on patients who did not require respiratory support. \u201cCurrent evidence demonstrates low-dose dexamethasone treatment has a clear benefit for severe hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with the greatest benefit observed for patients that require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation, who are above 70 years,\u201d according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Doctors say dexamethasone has proven to be a very helpful tool and one with which they have decades of experience. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that the most helpful drug in treating COVID-19 is dexamethasone,\u201d Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toronto, told Global News. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty strong steroid. And it really seems to reduce the risk of death in people that are sick enough with COVID-19 such that they require supplemental oxygen. \u201cAny hospital caring for patients with COVID-19 is very likely using a lot of dexamethasone.\u201d According to the   (WHO), dexamethasone is considered to be generally safe, with no serious side effects. However, prolonged use of more than two weeks may cause glaucoma, cataracts, fluid retention, hypertension, psychological effects, weight gain, or increased risk of infections and osteoporosis, WHO says. Remdesivir was the first drug conditionally authorized for use by Health Canada on July 27 for coronavirus patients with severe symptoms. In September, the country secured a supply of up to 150,000 vials of remdesivir. Developed by U.S. biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences, this repurposed antiviral drug is only administered intravenously, limiting its access to the public. It has shown promise in two major clinical trials in Canada, but the CPTG recommends that\u00a0remdesivir should only be administered as part of a randomized controlled trial. It had previously been explored in diseases like hepatitis C and Ebola, but did not meet efficacy standards for those illnesses. On Nov. 20, the WHO   the use of remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, saying there is currently no evidence that the drug improves survival and other outcomes in these patients. Bogoch said its efficacy is debatable and the drug is in limited supply. It continues to be used in clinical trials in Canada in health-care facilities where patients can be closely monitored and the license is subject to more data becoming available. Canada is also set to roll out monoclonal antibodies to treat COVID-19 patients. Bamlanivimab by the U.S. company Eli Lilly is the first coronavirus antibody treatment to be  . The government authorized its use on Nov. 20 for adults and children aged 12 or older with mild to moderate disease but at high risk of progressing to severe illness. Last week, Prime Minister\u00a0 \u00a0said Canada has secured up to  . Bamlanivimab is specifically directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, designed to block the virus\u2019 attachment to and entry into human cells,\u00a0 . \u201cThis would theoretically prevent people who aren\u2019t sick enough with COVID-19 to be in hospital but have risk factors for severe illness, if you could somehow give it to people early on in their course of illness, maybe you could prevent them from progressing to a severity of illness such that they land in hospital,\u201d Bogoch said. The therapy is still undergoing additional testing to establish its safety and effectiveness. Health Canada\u2019s interim   of the drug was based on a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. The patients treated with bamlanivimab showed reduced viral load and rates of symptoms and hospitalization. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t But experts say there are still questions over its efficacy and use. \u201cIt\u2019s an intravenous infusion and requires specific nursing, pharmacy and physical location resources to administer,\u201d Lee said. \u201cAnd I think, within the Canadian COVID-19 research community, there is some question about whether the data is strong enough to go to a more widespread use of that.\u201d \u201cIn order for there to be broader uptake in Canada, we really need to see a more robust Phase III randomized controlled trial.\u201d Bogoch agreed, saying this type of treatment will have considerable logistical challenges, as the IV setup will require resources, skill and time, which is not easy to do in an outpatient setting. Convalescent plasma treatment involves taking blood samples from people who have recovered from COVID-19, as these may contain antibodies to fight off the virus, to treat others. In Canada, convalescent plasma has not been authorized as a treatment option, as its safety and effectiveness for treating COVID-19 have not been fully established. Currently, it is only being assessed in a nationwide clinical trial,  , by the Canadian Blood Services and H\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec. Recent studies on convalescent plasma in India and Argentina have shown limited effectiveness. Experts in Canada say the verdict is still out on this treatment and more research is needed. \u201cThere have been, unfortunately, a couple of recent reasonable-sized, randomized controlled trials which did not show a benefit to convalescent plasma, but they have their limitations in terms of size or in terms of the population,\u201d Lee said. Bogoch added that it was still important to complete the ongoing studies to see if they come up with different results. Some other promising drugs are also being studied in Canadian-led clinical trials. Among them is  , which is an anti-inflammatory drug that is orally administered and most commonly used for gout and other inflammatory disorders. Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif, director of the Research Center at the Montreal Heart Institute, which is conducting the clinical trial along with Hamilton Health Sciences in Ontario, is optimistic colchicine may be a significant asset in the global fight against COVID-19 by reducing inflammatory storms in patients with the disease, preventing hospitalizations and even deaths. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cColchicine is a remarkably cost-effective and well-tolerated medication with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties,\u201d Tardif said in a   in August. Lee told Global News there was a lot of interest in that medicine globally. \u201cThe recovery trial in the United Kingdom has also picked up colchicine and will start testing it in the inpatient sphere in conjunction with dexamethasone as a standard of care for patients who require oxygen or who are critically ill.\u201d Meanwhile, the University of Manitoba and University Health Network in Toronto are also looking at the anticoagulant drug heparin, which is a blood thinner used to prevent blood clots, as a potential treatment for COVID-19. \u201cThe research sphere is very active at present. There\u2019s a lot of Canadian presence in these studies and hopefully we\u2019ll get some answers soon,\u201d Lee said."},

Until now,  \u00a0had only been approved for Canadians over the age of 16. \u201cThis is the first vaccine authorized in Canada for the prevention of COVID-19 in children, and marks a significant milestone in Canada\u2019s fight against the pandemic,\u201d said Health Canada\u2019s chief medical advisor Dr. Supriya Sharma. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Canada is the first country in the world to extend this approval to children, Sharma added. The announcement comes after the drugmakers said their vaccine was found to be safe and effective and produced robust antibody responses in 12- to 15-year-olds in a clinical trial late last month. The companies said more than 2,200 adolescents between 12 and 15 participated in the trial. A total of 18 cases of the coronavirus were identified in the group that was given a placebo shot, but no infections were declared in the group that was given the COVID-19 vaccine. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, 20 per cent of cases have been among Canadians under the age of 19, according to Sharma. \u201cWhile younger people are less likely to experience serious cases of COVID-19, having access to a safe and effective vaccine will help to control the disease\u2019s spread to their families and friends \u2014 some of whom may be at a higher risk of complications,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cIt will also support the return to a more normal life for our children, who have had such a hard time over the past year.\u201d The Health Canada approval comes with some strings attached. Like all other vaccine approvals that were made under interim orders, Pfizer-BioNTech has to keep Health Canada up to date with \u201cadditional information\u201d on the vaccine\u2019s \u201csafety efficacy and quality\u201d to make sure the benefits continue to outweigh the risks. As things stand now, Sharma said the benefits of the jab clearly outweigh the risks. \u201cThe safety profile of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in 12- to 15-year-olds is similar to what we saw for older people. That is, the most commonly reported side effects were temporary and mild, like a sore arm, chills or fever,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also know that millions of people have received the Pfizer vaccine, and no new safety issues have been identified.\u201d There are no vaccines currently approved in Canada for children under the age of 12 \u2014 but Sharma said research into the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for younger kids is underway now. \u201cPfizer does have ongoing trials in younger age groups as well,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cThey\u2019ve signalled that they may be giving Health Canada a submission for the younger age groups of five to 11 as soon as September.\u201d There are other clinical trials underway for that same age group, she added, but Health Canada doesn\u2019t \u201chave specific timing\u201d on when they would receive those submissions. \u201cWe may be getting those in the in the next few months,\u201d Sharma said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The timing of when these vaccines will be given to younger children, even once approved, will be based on provincial rollout decisions, according to Sharma. \u201cThe use of those vaccines really is dependent on the provinces and territories that need to look at their own demographics, their priority groups and how they how they use the supply,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it really would depend on the provinces and territories about when the availability would be there for the younger age groups and then what implications that would have with respect to school opening.\u201d Overall, Sharma said Wednesday\u2019s announcement is \u201cgood news.\u201d \u201cWe are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but until the majority of Canadians are vaccinated, we need to continue to be diligent about following public health guidelines,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cThat means keeping our physical distance, continuing to wear a mask and washing our hands.\u201d"},

Twenty per cent said they are receiving all their regular pay, despite lost work; the remaining have some sort of pay but not full. The loss of work has had a \u201cdisproportionate impact\u201d on younger Canadians, explained Angus Reid Institute\u2019s executive director Shachi Kurl. \u201cWho are younger workers here? They\u2019re servers, they\u2019re people working in the service industry, people working in retail, people working in the hospitality and tourism sector,\u201d Kurl said. Canadians aged 18 to 24 made up 45 per cent of the total number of those who lost work or jobs, followed by those between the ages of 24 and 34 at 30 per cent. The loss of work was felt fairly evenly by Canadians across different wage brackets, Kurl noted.

In British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada the per cent of households who reported losses ranged from 42 to 47 per cent. Saskatchewan and Manitoba saw the lowest number of job losses in the country at 37 and 32 per cent, respectively. Layoffs have hit several Canadian sectors in the past days, with more expected in the coming weeks and months as some provinces shutter all businesses except essential services. Many Canadians surveyed said they need financial support urgently. Thirty-seven per cent of those who have lost work said they are not equipped to handle an extra $100 in expenses over the next 30 days. One in three households also said they may miss a rent or mortgage payment this month. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t On Tuesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government is working as fast as it can to get money to Canadians. \u201cWe\u2019ve put forward measures that will get money out to them quickly,\u201d Trudeau told reporters outside his home in Ottawa, where he is in self-isolation. \u201cRecognize that the demand is massive across the country, and we are working very, very hard to be able to flow money to people very rapidly,\u201d he added. While the Trudeau government put forward a $82-billion emergency relief plan for Canadians affected by coronavirus fallout, it has faced questions about why the government is not directly sending cheques to Canadians like some other countries have promised. \u201cNothing is off the table,\u201d Trudeau said on the issue on Tuesday. \u201cWe are looking at a broad range of measures for supporting vulnerable people, for supporting businesses, small businesses specifically, and giving more help for Canadians.\u201d COVID-19 has produced a rapid downshift in the economy as businesses are forced to close and Canadians asked to stay home, which has led to a sharp drop in consumer spending and a sharp jump in claims for employment insurance benefits. Last week alone, the government received 500,000 new EI claims. Many Canadians have reported experiencing difficulty making claims amid high demand. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t According to the survey, thirty-one per cent of Canadians who have lost work said they have already applied for EI, but more than half called the process \u201cdifficult.\u201d In addition to technical issues, personal finance expert Rubina Ahmed-Haq noted that many Canadians are also facing misinformation and confusion when trying to access government funds. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to ask Twitter, you don\u2019t need to ask your friends,\u201d she said, urging Canadians to get information from reliable sources, such as the government itself. Ahmed-Haq added that many Canadians already lived paycheque-to-paycheque before this pandemic caused greater uncertainty. She said that the coronavirus pandemic is an \u201cextreme example\u201d of why all Canadians need to work on having savings for an emergency. \u201cWhen the virus is contained, and we go back to some sort of normal \u2014 whatever the new normal is going to be \u2014 it\u2019s so important to start building that emergency fund.\u201d While the past few weeks have been difficult for many Canadians, Kurl noted there are some positives. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Nearly half Canadian households who experienced reduced work said they were \u201ccertain\u201d they would go back to normal workloads after the pandemic is under control, while another 35 per cent were \u201cpretty sure.\u201d Seventeen per cent were either doubtful or thought their jobs were gone forever. \u201cYou still have a significant level of people who think, oh yeah, I\u2019m coming back to my job for sure. There is that optimism or hope,\u201d Kurl said, cautioning these numbers may shift quickly."},

The CDC hasn\u2019t determined if there\u2019s really a link to the shots, and continues to urge that everyone 12 and older get vaccinated against COVID-19, which is far riskier than the vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine is available to those as young as 12; the Moderna shot remains cleared only for adult use. This kind of\u00a0heart\u00a0inflammation can be caused by a variety of infections, including a bout of COVID-19, as well as certain medications \u2014 and there have been rare reports following other types of vaccinations.

The committee cited concerns over reports of blood clots as its reason for issuing the new guidance. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cAs you\u2019ve heard, rare cases of serious blood clots that have been associated with low platelts have been reported in Europe following use of AstraZeneca vaccine in those populations,\u201d Dr. Shelley Deeks, vice-chair of the NACI said during a press conference Monday. Deeks said   has \u201cdetermined there is substantial uncertaintly\u201d around the benefit of providing AstraZeneca to adults under 55 years of age given the potential risk . Deeks said the NACI recommends those 55 and older can still receive the AstraZeneca vaccine.

However, she said cases in men have also been reported. Deeks added, though, that the majority of cases of VIPIT between four and 16 days after the patient received the vaccine.

Njoo said these side effects include shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling and persistent abdominal pain. Njoo said while the cases of VIPIT are \u201crare,\u201d Health Canada is taking the seriously. \u201cWe need to take a pause and look and examine the evolving nature of what\u2019s happening in Europe,\u201d he said. According to Health Canada, as of Thursday, a total of 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine had been delivered across Canada.

He said right now it\u2019s \u201cnot entirely clear\u201d what the link is between the vaccine and reported blood clot cases. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that this chapter hasn\u2019t been fully written,\u201d he said.

The total cost of these beefed-up benefits will be $12.1 billion, the government confirmed on Friday. \u201cTo begin with, we are extending the Canada Recovery Benefit and the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit by 12 weeks. That makes the new maximum that you can claim 38 weeks in total,\u201d Trudeau said, speaking in a Friday press conference. Trudeau added that the government is also increasing the EI availability to 50 weeks in total, meaning an additional 24 weeks can be claimed. Trudeau also said the $500 per week Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit is getting a boost, from covering two weeks of missed work to a new total of four weeks. \u201cNo one should be going to work sick right now. It\u2019s that simple,\u201d Trudeau said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Prior to this change, both the CRB and the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) were only available for a total of 26 weeks. The new announcement will allow Canadians to access an additional 12 weeks of either benefit, which each offer the recipients $500 per week. The freshly extended CRB is available to anyone who isn\u2019t eligible for EI but has stopped working or had their income reduced by at least 50 per cent due to COVID-19. The CRCB, on the other hand, is given out by household and covers those who are unable to work for at least half of the week because they have to take care of their kids or a family member due to school or care facility closures. It also covers those who have to stay home with sick children or family members, or who are quarantining. The sickness benefit covers anyone who has to stay home for at least half the week because they\u2019ve caught COVID-19 or are self-isolating for reasons related to COVID-19. \u201cIf you need support while you look for a job, or if you have to stay home to take care of family, these benefits will continue to be there for you,\u201d Trudeau said. In the wake of Trudeau\u2019s announcement, Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough called on the provinces to beef up their benefits in lockstep with the federal government. \u201cPaid sick leave has been a key component of our public health response from the beginning,\u201d Qualtrough said, speaking to reporters in a Friday press conference. \u201cI would urge provinces to step up for workers and do their part like some of their colleagues have.\u201d The prime minister\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of grim warnings from federal public health officials that Canada\u2019s recent decline in COVID-19 cases is under threat from new variants. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Modelling released Friday morning shows a steep spike in cases should restrictions be relaxed too soon. \u201cWith the emergence and spread of new variants of concern\u2026 unless we maintain and abide by stringent public health measures, we may not be able to avert a rapid resurgence of the epidemic in Canada,\u201d  , Canada\u2019s top doctor, said at a virtual press conference. Canada has so far logged 700 cases with \u201cvariants of concern\u201d (VOC), predominately the B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the U.K. All 10 provinces have reported cases, and five of those have evidence of community spread. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The decision to expand the benefits also comes hours after labour groups warned the government of a looming benefits cliff late next month when Canadians receiving EI or the recovery benefits would start maxing out their eligibility with job prospects bleak or non-existent. The Canadian Labour Congress and other groups asked the Liberals to extend eligibility for benefits at least until the end of the year, which is how long they believe it might take before the workers in hardest-hit industries get back on the job. Meanwhile, Canadians are anxiously waiting their turn to receive the coronavirus vaccine, which could help to usher in economic reopenings and, in turn, get Canadians back to work. The vaccine rollout is expected to ramp up later this year, with the Trudeau government standing firm on its promise that there will be enough vaccines for all Canadians who want one by September. However, that rollout has been off to a slow start when compared to countries such as the U.K. and the U.S., and has been hampered by reductions in deliveries amid overwhelming global demand. Still, Trudeau reiterated on Friday that the government\u2019s vaccination effort is \u201cin the ramp-up phase.\u201d \u201cHundreds of thousands of doses arriving each week means hundreds of thousands more people protected from COVID-19,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on \u2013 you, your family and your community.

I know you want predictability.\u201d According to the documents, close contact is the highest risk of transmitting the virus, which highlights the need for people to continue to physically distance, stay home when ill, wash hands frequently, and wear a mask. Toronto, Peel Region and Ottawa have seen the highest case counts during the second wave and were therefore placed in a \u201cmodified Stage 2\u201d shutdown for 28 days, which ends Nov. 7. York Region followed shortly after. The new framework aims to adjust and/or tighten measures as \u201ctrends in public health indicators improve.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The following levels were used: Prevent (standard measures \u2014 green), protect (strengthened measures \u2014 yellow), restrict (intermediate measures \u2014 orange), control (stringent measures \u2014 red), and lockdown (maximum measures \u2014 grey).

Control: No spectators allowed, however, rehearsals or recorded and broadcast events still allowed. The official Opposition expressed a lack of confidence in the plan Tuesday, saying many communities and small businesses simply can\u2019t afford to \u201cslide in and out\u201d of closures as they move between tiers. \u201cWe\u2019re quite concerned about the flexibility in this program that is being unveiled by the government,\u201d NDP legislator Taras Natyshak said, adding more support is needed to help businesses navigate the uncertainty. Some in the medical community expressed similar concerns. Infectious diseases physician Dr. Isaac Bogoch pointed to the measures for communities in the province\u2019s orange category \u2014 which allows for up to a ten per cent positivity rate in a community \u2014 as potentially too loose. \u201cSome of the metrics are too forgiving,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cThese would allow for significant community spread without imposing measures to curb transmission.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Dr. Michael Warner, the medical director of critical care at Michael Garron Hospital, said the new rules enable economic reopening at the expense of health and safety. \u201cThe framework proposed by (Premier Ford) enshrines exponential spread as acceptable,\u201d he wrote in a post online. The province also announced Tuesday that it will make up to $300 million available to businesses forced to shut down because of the restrictions imposed in hot spot regions. Those businesses can apply to the province starting Nov. 16 to help to pay their property taxes and energy costs. As of Tuesday, Ontario reported a single-day record high of 1,050 coronavirus cases, bringing the provincial total to 78,705. According to Tuesday\u2019s\u00a0 , 408 new cases were recorded in Toronto, 212 in Peel Region, 86 in Halton Region, 76 in York Region, 57 in Durham Region, 34 each in Ottawa and Hamilton, and 31 in Niagara. \u2014"},

The province\u2019s 41st case is a woman in her 30s who attended Hamilton Health Sciences with a travel history to the U.S. She is listed as self-isolating. According to hospital\u2019s  , the woman is a physician from the Juravinski Cancer Centre who underwent testing on March 9 after experiencing symptoms. She was officially diagnosed with COVID-19 the following day. \u201cShe was working at the Juravinski Cancer Center the afternoon of March 9 and saw patients and interacted with colleagues and staff. Those individuals are being contacted,\u201d Hamilton Health Sciences said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In an evening update Wednesday, officials confirmed the province\u2019s 42nd case of the new coronavirus involving a woman in her 40s who recently travelled to the U.S. She presented herself to St. Joseph\u2019s Health Centre in Toronto and is now listed as being in self-isolation. A man in his 50s from Sudbury who recently attended a convention in Toronto was confirmed late Tuesday night as having COVID-19. His form of transmission is \u201cpending\u201d according to Ontario\u2019s website. The man had attended Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada 2020 at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre from March 2-3. According to the convention\u2019s organizers, more than 25,000 people from over 132 countries attend the conference. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier Doug Ford were also at the convention and gave speeches. Officials have not listed any recent travel history for the Sudbury man. It was initially unclear if his case was being considered a case of community transmission, but in an update Wednesday afternoon, officials said that currently is not the case. \u201cTo me, this is not a case of community transmission,\u201d said Ontario\u2019s associate chief medical officer of health, Dr. Barbara Yaffe. \u201cTo me a case of community transmission would be a case where there\u2019s no travel history and you don\u2019t have any epidemiological link to another case. That is, you don\u2019t have any idea where they got it. With this person \u2026 it is likely he acquired it at that conference. There were 23 or something thousand people from many, many countries.\u201d It is not known, however, if the man contracted the virus from someone who travelled from another country. Yaffe added that Ontario can expect cases of community transmission in the future. \u201cUnfortunately, it probably is an inevitability,\u201d she said. As of Wednesday, five cases of the virus has been resolved in Ontario. Premier Ford also announced Wednesday that Ontario has set aside a $100-million contingency fund to deal with COVID-19, and Health Minister Christine Elliott said the money will likely go toward buying more equipment such as testing kits and personal protective gear, as well as hiring more health-care staff, if needed.

Alberta reported\u00a01,733 new cases of   on Monday \u2014 a new daily record. Eight additional deaths from the disease were also reported, bringing the provincial death toll to 541. Hospitalizations also increased to 453 province-wide. Of those in hospital Monday, 96 people were being treated in intensive care. Dr. Deena Hinshaw said she is \u201calarmed\u201d by the active case numbers reported Monday and over the past weekend. She suspects case counts and hospitalizations will continue to increase over the next several days, \u201cas we wait for the impact of the restrictions that were announced last week.\u201d \u201cIf we have continued spread, we are nowhere near that COVID-19 peak unless we can collectively bring our numbers down.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Dr. David Zygun, zone medical director with AHS, who joined Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health for Monday\u2019s daily COVID-19 update, said \u201cthere is no doubt that the hospital system is under significant strain. \u201cHaving said that, we\u2019ve planned extensively for it and we are executing those plans as the demand increases.\u201d Zygun said there are currently 173 general adult ICU beds in the province and AHS has plans to expand that up to a total of 425 ICU beds. In the last week, 20 additional beds were added in Edmonton and over the past weekend, 10 additional beds opened in Calgary to keep up with the demand, Zygun said. \u201cAs we start to expand capacity, we do have some capacity within our current ICU, so unfunded beds, and those are the first beds that are utilized,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the need for ICU beds increase, we will go into unconventional ICU spaces.\u201d Zygun said the spaces that would be utilized first include specialty ICUs like a cardiac ICU. If a more extreme need arises, AHS would turn to \u201creally unconventional spaces.\u201d \u201cThis would be areas like post-operative recovery rooms, operative rooms or other spaces.\u201d He went on to say that beds and equipment aren\u2019t the only need; staffing those areas is one of the \u201ckey challenges.\u201d \u201cFirst of all, we utilize those providers that are trained and are usually working in ICU environments \u2014 and that\u2019s physicians, nurses and respiratory therapists and social workers and our rehab colleagues,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we expand out, we\u2019ve obviously looked at those who have recently been in ICU and maybe moved on to other jobs to be redeployed. We\u2019ve also taken proactive measures to provide training for those in like-type specialties that could support our critical care teams. So this may be\u2026 operative room staff, post-operative recovery staff, emergency staff. \u201cWhat the teams have developed is a sequential level of support such that as the teams expand, we would use those non-traditional providers but be supported by the traditional providers in that so that we can provide safe and effective care.\u201d While Zygun said is reassured by the plans he has seen, he hopes it doesn\u2019t get to that. \u201cWe\u2019re first utilizing all of our conventional ICU beds and teams and will only do that unconventional-type spaces when absolutely needed, which we hope to avoid with public health measures and compliance with those.\u201d Earlier Monday, Premier Jason Kenney told Global News Radio 770 CHQR that Alberta\u2019s largest hospitals are at 91 per cent capacity due to COVID-19 cases. \u201cOur top 15 hospitals are increasingly under stress,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cUltimately, if we get more and more COVID patients in hospital, the response to open up (COVID) capacity will be widespread surgical cancellation.\u201d He said Alberta has 8,500 hospital beds. Some 2,400 are being set aside for pandemic patients and one-quarter of those beds will be in intensive care. \u201cWe have a plan to get back to that level of availably given the current surge that we see,\u201d Kenney said. In October, the Edmonton area began cancelling 30 per cent of non-urgent surgeries to deal with mounting COVID-19 caseloads. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Hinshaw stressed that \u201cat this time, there is adequate capacity to care for all those with COVID.\u201d \u201cHowever, we do need to make sure we\u2019re bending the curve early enough that we never get to that point where we don\u2019t have capacity to care for everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are exactly the reasons why we all need to work together to minimize our spread.\u201d Alberta\u2019s 1,733 new cases of   reported Monday breaks the previous daily record of 1,731 cases reported Saturday. Of the eight additional deaths reported Monday, three occurred in the Calgary zone: a man in his 80s, a woman in her 80s linked to the outbreak at The Hamlets at Cedarwood Station and a man in his 70s linked to the outbreak at Wing Kei Care Centre. Three deaths were reported in the Edmonton zone: a man in his 40s, a man in his 60s linked to the outbreak at Good Samaritan Pembina Village and a man in his 90s linked to the outbreak at South Terrace Continuing Care. A man in his 80s linked to the outbreak at Newbrook Lodge in the South zone died, as well as a man in his 90s linked to the outbreak at Rosealta Lodge in the Central zone. Monday\u2019s cases bring the total number of active cases in Alberta to 16,454. Of the active cases, the majority were located in the Edmonton zone, where there were 7,388 cases. Monday also marked the start of new school-related restrictions in Alberta, with students in grades 7 to 12 shifting to at-home learning until winter break starts on Dec. 18. Students in Kindergarten to Grade 6 will remain in the classroom until winter break. After winter break ends on Jan. 3, all students in all grades will learn at home for one full week before returning to in-person schooling on Jan. 11. Hinshaw said Monday there are currently active alerts or outbreaks in 376 schools, which is about 16 per cent of the schools in the province. The schools have a combined total of 1,405 active cases. \u201cWe can expect to see a reduction in the number of cases, outbreaks and alerts attributed to schools in the coming days,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cI do want to be clear, there is a lag time between action and results. While cases may not be attributed to schools as students are at home, they will still be reflected in our overall active cases.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Hinshaw is slated to provide an in-person update on the COVID-19 situation every day this week."},

Relationship expert Jessica O\u2019Reilly recently joined the hosts of Global News\u2019  to answer some of the most common questions around keeping (or ending) friendships during the coronavirus pandemic. One question, in particular, O\u2019Reilly says, is when friends choose not to comply with COVID-19 rules. If a friend isn\u2019t following social distancing rules or is seeing too many people as part of their bubbles, she says communication with this friend is key. \u201cI think it\u2019s definitely worth speaking up and setting your own boundaries,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t necessarily have to end the whole friendship,\u201d she added.\u00a0Instead, she advises changing the habitual interaction with your friend by meeting online or outdoors. Kate Mulligan, an associate professor at the University of Toronto\u2019s Dalla Lana School of Public Health,   it\u2019s important to remind friends that even if they feel healthy, they must respect social and physical distancing rules to protect vulnerable citizens like seniors, health-care workers and those with weakened immune systems. To put someone in the spotlight or to use anger as a form of expression toward friends going out isn\u2019t an efficient way to communicate with them, she said. Mulligan also recommended that individuals should try to share information from reliable sources like government sites and news organizations."},

A look at the ingredients - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted December 16, 2020 2:52 pm", "body": "The newness of the novel   coupled with the quick development of a   has put Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s shots under the proverbial microscope \u2014 particularly about the ingredients it uses. While there\u2019s no question this happened at warp speed, experts agree the listed ingredients are pretty standard. In fact, they\u2019re \u201calmost simpler and more straightforward than any other vaccine,\u201d according to Kyle Anderson, an assistant professor of biochemistry, microbiology and immunology at the University of Saskatchewan. \u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s a revolution in vaccine making,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in this vaccine that rings any alarm bells.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Pfizer\u2019s vaccine was   Canadians across the country have rolled up their sleeves this week to be among the first to receive the shot, which touts a   and no serious side effects. Its ingredients might look complicated, said Anderson, but they can be easily organized into four basic categories: This is the only active ingredient in the vaccine. The mRNA \u2014   \u2014 sends tiny snippets of genetic code to cells, telling them to build proteins. In this case, it triggers the immune system to produce protective antibodies without using actual bits of the virus. \u201cOld-fashioned\u201d types of vaccines, required scientists having to express it in cells or chicken eggs to get the proteins right, Anderson said. \u201cAnd then we had to do all this clean-up,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we had problems with cleaning and purifying it, we could get adverse reactions or add things like mercury compounds to stabilize that. \u2026 These are completely avoided with these mRNA-based vaccines.\u201d The mRNA-based vaccines may have more science behind them, but they\u2019re more efficient, Anderson said. \u201cEssentially, the message is telling your body how to make this one virus protein, and how to recognize it,\u201d he said. From there, the other ingredients form a \u201cbubble\u201d around the message, Anderson said, helping it become stable enough to get where it needs to go. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The lipid molecule in Pfizer\u2019s vaccine contains four components. \u201cEach is necessary for the mRNA \u2014 the medicinal ingredient \u2014 to gain entry into cells and be expressed,\u201d said Roderick Slavcev, a professor at the University of Waterloo\u2019s School of Pharmacy. Slavcev and a team are currently developing a DNA-based vaccine. The molecule essentially protects the mRNA. Without it, the vital active ingredient could be broken down before getting that genetic code to the cell. This connection of fat is particularly delicate, experts say, which is why the Pfizer vaccine requires a subzero temperature for storage. Of all the ingredients, it\u2019s the lipids that have been misunderstood, Anderson believes. This is, in part, due to two vaccine recipients in the U.K.  . It\u2019s been suggested that the reactions may have been caused by polyethylene glycol, or PEG, which helps stabilize the shot and is used in some other vaccines. But the ingredient is already widely used, Slavcevs said, and there is no reason to be concerned. PEG is found in a range of pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food products. It is also safely used at higher concentrations as a laxative. Slavcev said there have been some minor side effects recorded with PEG, but they\u2019re often as a result of taking high concentrations. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The 0.05 mg of PEG in Pfizer\u2019s vaccine is \u201csuch a small quantity,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the carrier of the message. It\u2019s the envelope that your letter came in, and then you recycle the paper,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you eat, say, a steak, you\u2019re getting a lot of these fats and in far higher quantities, but they\u2019re digested and you just don\u2019t think about it.\u201d Lipids might also have a bad rap because \u201cthey have such long, complicated, really unpronounceable names,\u201d he added. \u201cIt kind of reads like a shampoo bottle,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cAll these Xs and Ys and Zs and numbers, it looks like an alien language. And it is to most of us. But it\u2019s just essentially a fat droplet.\u201d Salts, like fats, are nothing new to vaccines, the experts agree. They\u2019re there for two reasons \u2014 to balance and to stabilize. Having salt components allows cells to retain their proper shape, Anderson said. \u201cIf you get an IV at the hospital, there are salts and sugars in there. It makes your cells a little happier. They\u2019re there to help balance it out,\u201d he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Components like potassium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate are there to make sure the pH \u2014 the acidity of a solution \u2014 is stable. They\u2019re actually variants of salt natural to the body that keep the pH balanced, Anderson said. The combination of these particular salts helps the body absorb the solution while also protecting the fat molecule and mRNA. \u201cIt\u2019s going to last longer from the time of thawing it to injecting it in you,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf there happened to be something slightly acidic in the syringe being using, that could destroy the vaccine. So this is really a protective measure that pH is going to be balanced across the time it actually reaches your cells.\u201d The sugar-water mixture is there to protect and to stabilize the vaccine during freezing. Pfizer\u2019s vaccine needs to be stored at an ultracold -70 C. The sugar helps keep things stable under this temperature, the experts said. It is, again, another common addition to a vaccine and other drug and pharmaceutical products. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cWe\u2019re more likely to not trust something that we haven\u2019t seen or heard of before,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cSucrose, we know it\u2019s sugar. But we don\u2019t necessarily think about all these fats in our body that have these complicated names, and there are hundreds more with complicated names.\u201d Ultimately, there\u2019s nothing in that ingredient list that is questionable or unnecessary, Slavcev said. \u201cPotentials for allergic responses or other adverse responses are always possible. It\u2019s impossible to predict how every human will react,\u201d he said, adding that all adverse reactions are and will continue to be documented. As for the speed of the vaccine\u2019s development? Get used to it. \u201cThis is the future of vaccines,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThere comes a time in the complexity of how things are made \u2014 whether it\u2019s a computer program, a car, a drug, food \u2014 where you need to trust that there are experts who are critical enough to inspect this and ensure safety.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is one of the most scrutinized vaccines ever made. It hasn\u2019t been rushed, but there has been no delay.\u201d"},

He also said the government will implement a curfew where case rates are significantly high, specifically case rates above 1,000 per 100,000,   if a municipality or region requests it. Starting Friday, Alberta will also close indoor fitness and indoor sports in the hot spot regions. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThese targeted restrictions will remain in place for at least two weeks for any community or area that reaches this trigger,\u201d the government said in a news release. \u201cAfter 14 days, the enhanced measures will be lifted once the municipality falls back below the threshold.\u201d Those regions are areas that have a COVID-19 case rate of at least 350 per 100,000 population and 250 currently active cases. They are: Kenney called this a \u201chard but necessary step.\u201d \u201cI know we\u2019re all tired of this pandemic.\u201d He said the targeted COVID-19 restrictions will be implemented to drive down case numbers and protect the health care system. Currently, Alberta has more than 21,000 active cases \u2014 the most the province has ever had during the pandemic. Of all active cases, 63 per cent involve variants of concern. Dr. Deena Hinshaw said Thursday Alberta confirmed 2,048 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours out of 20,500 tests, putting the provincial positivity rate at 10.1 per cent. Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health said more than 1,300 cases involving variants were identified. He said hospitalizations have been \u201crising sharply.\u201d There are 632 Albertans in hospital and 151 in ICU. \u201cThat too is a record for Alberta during the pandemic,\u201d Kenney said. AHS has already been forced to start postponing surgeries in some zones. Kenney said that will enable hospitals to expand in-patient beds, where necessary, and create more capacity for COVID-19 patients. \u201cWe know that hospitalizations will continue to go up and this is a problem,\u201d the premier said. \u201cIt impacts everyone who needs care for any reason,\u201d he added, referencing car accidents, cancer diagnosis and other health needs. He had hoped the move back to Step 1 announced about three weeks ago would have had more impact, Kenney said. But as case rates continue to rise, along with hospitalizations \u2014 and with the vaccines not arriving quickly enough \u2014 Alberta must act, he said. \u201cBased on supply, we still have many weeks to go until we reach broader community protection.\u201d As of Wednesday,\u00a01,528,569 doses of COVID-19 vaccine had been administered and\u00a0292,765 Albertans were fully immunized. Kenney said the province is also working with the restaurant industry to ensure people who are dining on patios are only doing so with their household. He also said the province is considering implementing a curfew \u201cwhere needed\u201d where case rates are significantly high \u2014\u00a01,000 or more cases per 100,000 population or where the municipal government requests it. The Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, which would qualify given its case rate, has not requested a curfew at this time. \u201cWe are in the process of reviewing the newly announced restrictions, evaluating options, and awaiting further details from the government,\u201d a RMWB spokesperson told Global News. \u201cI\u2019m going to say something I\u2019ve never said before,\u201d the premier said. \u201cI encourage people, if they can possible do so, to stay home\u2026 to stay in their community.\u201d Kenney said the province would be adding \u201cadditional backstops\u201d with stronger fine collection at registry services. He said that would mean someone who\u2019s been fined for breaking a public health order and not paid the fine might be restricted from renewing their driver\u2019s licence, for instance. \u201cThis is for the people who aren\u2019t taking the pandemic seriously by putting others at risk by following the public health measures in place.\u201d Three additional deaths were reported to Alberta Health in the last 24 hours. All three included comorbidities. A woman in her 50s in the South zone died from COVID-19, along with two men in the Calgary zone: one in his 70s and one in his 80s. Dr. Chris Mody, head of Microbiology, Immunology and Infectious Diseases at the University of Calgary, said Alberta needs restrictions to \u201csnap the curve down,\u201d and the ones implemented so far aren\u2019t doing enough. Mody said in November and December, when Alberta was fighting its second wave, the restrictions put in place brought case numbers down dramatically. However, he said those restrictions aren\u2019t going to be enough to gain control of the variants of concern now dominating spread in the province. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to actually really implement some restrictions and they\u2019re going to be tough and there are going to be a lot of people that are going to have concerns about that,\u201d Mody said. \u201cThis is a race and it\u2019s a race of vaccines versus variants. And the variants are coming strong. And vaccines, despite our best efforts, have been slow.\u201d Mody said two key things are needed for the province to start to move into recovery mode from the third wave: Albertans need to adhere to public health measures and enforcement against those who disregard them needs to be stronger. \u201cAnd then it\u2019s an issue of how tight do we lock everything down and do we go back to where we were this time last year?\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Mody said Alberta doesn\u2019t have the capacity to deal with another variant that may not be as responsive to the current vaccines, unlike the ones currently spreading in the population, and is also highly \u2014 or more \u2014 transmissible. \u201cWe\u2019re really right up against the edge. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much the edge of this particular variant which does respond to the vaccine \u2014 we have every opportunity to deal with this particular variant,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to build a little bit of slack into the system in terms of possible hospitalizations, beds, procedures that are being done, get (case) numbers down so that contact tracing can occur quickly and efficiently, so that if \u2014 and we all hope it won\u2019t come \u2014 but if a variant comes and it\u2019s not so responsive to the vaccine, we have the capacity to deal with that quickly. \u201cRight now, we don\u2019t have that capacity and the new variant would go through the community very quickly. And if it was transmissible and also not responsive to the vaccine, we\u2019d be in a very concerning situation. So it\u2019s very important that we do this now.\u201d The Opposition criticized Kenney for his \u201cmismanagement\u201d of the crisis and his confusing messaging. \u201cHe has repeatedly contradicted himself and ignored advice from medical professionals while routinely downplaying the severity of COVID-19,\u201d NDP health critic David Shepherd said. \u201cOur hospitals are on the verge of being overwhelmed despite the premier promising he\u2019d never let it get to that point.\u201d NDP education critic Sarah Hoffman said her heart goes out to Alberta parents and kids, after Kenney announced junior and senior high students in \u201chot spots\u201d would be moving back to at-home learning for at least two weeks. \u201cParents will suffer so much as they try to both do their jobs and take even more responsibility for their child\u2019s education,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cAlberta\u2019s kids are paying the price for his weak and ineffective leadership.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In an emailed statement, the City of Calgary responded to the targeted restrictions. \u201cWe are currently working through the updated provincial public health measures to understand their impacts on our own operations, services and facilities. \u201cBased on initial interpretation\u2026 starting on Friday, April 30, 2021 all indoor sport, fitness and recreation activities will be suspended until further notice. Outdoor recreational activities are currently allowed.\u201d Alberta Health Services said Monday it had added 19 ICU beds in the Edmonton zone. On Thursday, AHS said 11 more ICU beds were added, putting Edmonton zone\u2019s ICU bed total at 102. Alberta Health Services said a significant portion of the appointments for COVID-19 tests in the Calgary zone are turning out to be no shows. \u201cFor the third day in a row, over 1,000 people who booked a COVID-19 test appointment in the Calgary zone did not show up for their test. That amounts to nearly 20 per cent of bookings,\u201d an AHS spokesperson said Thursday. There\u2019s been high demand for test appointments in that zone, AHS added, and it can still take up to three to five days to get a COVID-19 test. AHS has expanded capacity and added a new temporary COVID-19 assessment and testing site in northeast Calgary. AHS is urging anyone who no longer needs their booked COVID-19 test to cancel it. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Earlier on Thursday, Alberta announced the rest of those who qualify under Phase 2C and 2D can start booking COVID-19 vaccines on Friday. Those phases include designated support people for seniors in care, anyone 50 or older and any First Nations Albertan 35 or older. Phase 2C was also expanded to include firefighters. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Eligibility also expanded for people in targeted regions of the province, including the Cargill meat plant, Fort McMurray and Banff."},

As coronavirus cases continue to rise, it\u2019s important to be able to tell the difference between the symptoms of a common cold, influenza and COVID-19. But this also may be difficult to do. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Influenza, the common cold and COVID-19 are all contagious respiratory illnesses, and are caused by different viruses. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2), the flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses and the common cold is caused by countless viruses such as rhinovirus and coronavirus. Dr. Jerome Leis, medical director of infection prevention and control at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, said there are subtle differences between all three sicknesses, but they can be difficult to determine. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunately impossible to reliably distinguish the cold from a virus-like influenza or COVID-19,\u201d he said. \u201cThe symptoms are just too non-specific. And we know from COVID-19 that there is a wide spectrum of different presentations, (including) extremely mild symptoms that could resemble the common cold. So, unfortunately, we can\u2019t distinguish those without testing.\u201d Here are some differences in the illnesses. The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, a persistent dry cough, and fatigue, according to Health Canada. Other symptoms include shortness of breath, a loss of sense of taste and smell, and a rash on skin or discolouration of fingers or toes. This can also be accompanied by aches and pains, a headache and gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, or vomiting). Upper respiratory symptoms, like runny nose and sinus congestion, are very uncommon in COVID-19. \u201cThere are some symptoms that might be potentially distinguishing like the loss of taste or smell that\u2019s widely reported \u2026 (or) change in the skin that might occur. But I really would not rely on those for people to self-diagnosis with COVID-19,\u201d Leis explained. The most common symptoms of influenza are fever, fatigue, a dry cough, aches and pains and headaches. Some people may experience a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose. Diarrhea can sometimes occur in children. Sneezing is usually not associated with the flu, but shortness of breath can develop. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Because COVID-19 and the flu tend to affect the lungs and lead to severe complications, the two illnesses can be very difficult to distinguish, according to Dr. Zain Chagla, an infectious disease expert with McMaster University. \u201cUnfortunately muscle pains, cough, fever, nausea, shortness of breath, all of those fit COVID-19. And they fit influenza. So from a clinical standpoint, they\u2019re very hard to distinguish,\u201d he said. While you may feel miserable when you have a cold, the symptoms are generally mild compared to the other viruses. The symptoms tend to stay in the upper airways, meaning you\u2019re most likely to experience a stuffy or runny nose, sneezing and a sore throat, according to Health Canada. While a fever is common with COVID-19 and the flu, it is rarely a symptom of a cold. Leis warned that people should not solely rely on the symptoms above for self-diagnosing. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t"},

Sienna Senior Living and Revera Inc. long-term care facilities have lost 525 residents altogether, according to the figures. The data also shows that more than half the deaths at all nursing homes in the province were at facilities owned by six companies. The province puts the number of nursing home deaths related to COVID-19 at 1,786 as of June 12. The data is self-reported by the long-term care homes to the province. Canada\u2019s long-term care homes have borne the brunt of the pandemic. In Ontario, more than 7,000 residents and staff have become infected, and almost three-quarters of those who died were nursing homes residents. While there were outbreaks at several hundred care homes, a much smaller number suffered large-scale deaths \u2014 and most were owned by a handful of private companies. Using Ontario government figures on COVID-19 deaths in long-term care, Global News matched each home with an outbreak to its owner to see how they had fared during the pandemic. The numbers only include deaths at homes that lost five or more residents, as the province does not release figures for care homes with fewer than five resident deaths. As the largest owners, Sienna and Revera were particularly hard hit. Sienna homes have lost 295 residents to the pandemic, while Revera homes have seen 230 deaths. Many of their homes had no deaths or outbreaks. Six Sienna homes experienced 20 or more deaths, compared with four Revera homes and four Rykka homes. Two Sienna homes had more than 50 deaths, as well as two Revera homes. Of the 14 homes that lost more than a quarter of their residents, three were Sienna homes, two were Southbridge homes and one was a Rykka home. Three were non-profits. At four Revera homes, at least 20 per cent of residents died. \u201cWe have a very serious problem with long-term care facilities, but it\u2019s not a problem that started with COVID-19,\u201d said professor Tamara Daly, a professor of health policy and director of York University\u2019s Centre for Aging Research & Education who has been studying the issue for two decades. Ontario has the highest number of for-profit care homes in Canada, with 57 per cent of the more than 600 facilities owned or managed by for-profits, according to Daly\u2019s research. In B.C. and Alberta, roughly 44 per cent and 40 per cent are for-profits. Understaffing and reliance on part-time workers were key drivers in nursing home outbreaks, said Daly. For-profit homes generally had more part-time and casual workers, which can lead to a greater spread of infection as staff employed at multiple facilities move between workplaces, she said. Non-profit and municipal homes tended to have higher levels of full-time staff, meaning support workers had a better understanding of the needs of those they were caring for, Daly said. \u201cYou have better care outcomes associated with more continuity. It\u2019s really straightforward,\u201d she said. But the debate over private versus public homes is far from settled. According to SEIU Healthcare, the union representing thousands of the province\u2019s long-term care workers, for-profit homes had 7.2 deaths per bed during the pandemic. By contrast, homes operated by non-profit groups had 4.5 deaths per bed, while those owned by municipal governments fared best, with 2.4 deaths per bed, the union said. Preliminary data from Ontario Long Term Care Association, however, said 85 per cent of privately-owned homes had no deaths as a result of COVID-19, compared to 82 per cent of not-for-profit homes. A Sienna spokesperson said that while some of its homes were \u201chit by challenging outbreaks, the vast majority of our 70 residences across the country have experienced few, if any, cases of COVID-19.\u201d Natalie Gokchenian said in a statement that \u201chaving reviewed current information, I can confirm that the number of deaths as a percentage of outbreak beds is lower than that of other long-term care providers in the province.\u201d One of the country\u2019s largest long-term care providers, Sienna operates homes in Ontario and British Columbia. The company reported profits of $7.5-million in 2019, down from $21.8-million in 2017. Sienna homes include Camilla Care Community, where 68 have died, and Madonna Care Community, with 46 deaths. The Canadian Forces was deployed to Sienna\u2019s Altamont Care Community, which has had 53 deaths. At Altamont, the military reported \u201csignificant staffing issues\u201d and underfed residents. Most recently, troops were sent to Sienna\u2019s Woodbridge Vista, where 62 residents and staff are infected, and 23 have died. Sienna president and CEO Lois Cormack   for personal reasons, the company announced Friday. \u201cSince the beginning of the pandemic, we have worked closely with public health authorities and health-care partners to ensure all precautions, protocols and directives are in place and that we continue to have adequate supplies of personal protective equipment available for all team members,\u201d Gokchenian said. The company has launched a six-point plan that aims to improve operations and delivery of care, she said. \u201cThe action plan includes an immediate, company-wide review into our policies, practices and culture at Sienna led by former Deputy Attorney General of Ontario, Paul Boniferro.\u201d Revera Inc. owns and operates more than 500 seniors residences in North America and the United Kingdom. Its Ontario homes include Carlingview Manor in Ottawa, which has had 61 resident deaths, and Forest Heights in Kitchener, where 51 have died. The company is owned by PSP Investments, a Crown corporation and the investment arm for federal public servant pensions. Revera is also facing two class-action lawsuits in   and  . \u201cSome Revera homes have suffered serious outbreaks, and the hearts of our entire organization go out to the families and friends of the people we have lost to this tragic pandemic and the staff who cared for them,\u201d said company spokesperson Larry Roberts. \u201cThere are many variables and factors that have played a part in why COVID-19 spread and affected some homes and not others, however objective data has not shown that ownership is one of them.\u201d Roberts said the company was \u201cadapting and evolving our practices and protocols in accordance with the latest medical advice and public health directives.\u201d He said Revera would respond to lawsuits against the company \u201cin due course in the appropriate forum.\u201d Ontario Long Term Care Minister Merrilee Fullerton\u2019s office said ward rooms and congestion had amplified the spread of COVID-19 at nursing homes. \u201cThese are long-standing structural and capacity issues that, coupled with a severe staffing shortage that predates the virus, have led to the tragedy we have seen in our homes,\u201d the statement said. The union representing federal public servants wants PSP Investments to divest itself of Revera Inc. amid what it called \u201cmounting and overwhelming evidence\u201d of the \u201cextremely disproportionate\u201d rate of COVID-19 infection and death in long-term-care homes. Homes run by Rykka, an operating partner of Responsive Management Inc., based in Markham, Ont., had 132 deaths at four facilities, the third-most in the province, the analysis of government data shows. They include Hawthorne Place Care Centre and Eatonville Care Centre, where a   said residents were left in soiled diapers and there was a \u201cculture of fear\u201d among workers worried about using supplies like wipes, gloves and dressing gowns. Responsive Management said the company was spending all the money it received from the government on staffing, support services, food and supplies like personal protective equipment. \u201cMost of our homes managed to keep COVID-19 at bay and the rest have turned the corner thanks to the dedicated efforts of our staff,\u201d said Linda Calabrese, vice-president of operations. \u201cMany of our staff members have been able to come back to work and we are seeing residents recover fully. We are hopeful that we can declare the outbreak over in our homes soon,\u201d she said. Ontario\u2019s worst-hit home was Orchard Villa, with 70 deaths. The company that owns the facility, Southbridge, had a total of 126 COVID-19 deaths at five homes, according to the analysis of government data. \u201cWhile the majority of our homes had no or very few cases, COVID-19 presented Orchard Villa with some unique challenges as one of the homes that went into outbreak early,\u201d company spokesperson Richard Franzke said. \u201cThe guidance and recommendations from government and health authorities evolved since then, which ultimately enhanced the support for the sector. The home also experienced staffing shortages as a result of COVID-19. To address our staffing needs, we reached out for help early and often.\u201d \u201cNothing is more important to us than the residents in our care, and we want to ensure that we are always meeting or exceeding our commitment to providing the highest standard of care.\u201d Sharleen Stewart, president of SEIU Healthcare, said private homes received the same provincial funding from the provincial government but also had to generate profits for shareholders, meaning there was less to spend on staff and supplies. \u201cEven before COVID we could see the difference from the staffing perspective,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe workers were telling us how different it was in those homes, and as you know, they do work in more than one.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pretty glaring that the for-profits have got a real problem.\u201d She said the union is calling for an inquiry into what happened. \u201cIt\u2019s not to point fingers. It\u2019s to identify what didn\u2019t work and what worked. I mean, look at the municipal homes and the not-for-profits, they have better outcomes, and they have the same issues.\u201d The Ontario Health Coalition said staffing was a key factor in the pandemic. In April, the staffing crisis worsened when employees were banned from working at multiple locations in order to curb the spread of COVID-19, forcing them to choose a single home. Many chose not to work at for-profit homes, which generally offered worse wages, benefits and working conditions than facilities operated by non-profits or municipalities, said executive director Natalie Mehra. She said the coalition\u2019s research had discounted factors such as the number of beds operated by owners and the acuity of the resident population as a measure of how homes had coped with the pandemic. \u201cAnd so the bottom line is it is now irrefutable that the for-profit homes, the larger chains, in particular, have a strong correlation with the highest death rates of COVID-19 in our province.\u201d Stewart.Bell@globalnews.ca Andrew.Russell@globalnews.ca"},
{"title": "How effective is a single dose of a COVID-19 vaccine? - Winnipeg | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted April 9, 2021 4:56 pm", "body": "More and more Manitobans are getting inoculated against  , but the majority have just had a single dose so far. As of Friday, 259,847 doses of vaccine have been administered in the province, including 192,131 first doses and 67,716 second doses. But just how safe are you on a single dose of the vaccine? A letter by two Canadian experts published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) earlier this year stated that with a 92.6 per cent efficacy, the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine was \u201chighly protective.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Several provinces, including Manitoba, have delayed their second doses in order to prioritize getting as many Manitobans vaccinated as possible. Dr. Joss Reimer, the medical lead of Manitoba\u2019s vaccine implementation task force, said they based that decision on studies in British Columbia, Manitoba, Quebec, the U.K. and Israel. \u201cAll of them showed that the first doses in real-world effectiveness provided either in the 70s or 80s per cent protection,\u201d Reimer said during a press conference Friday. \u201cWhich in real-world numbers is highly effective. So we were very happy to see that after one dose, we would be very happy to see effectiveness in the 80s after two doses.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Reimer also says the length of immunity based on a single dose was another reassuring factor. \u201cThe immunity lasted for the entire length of the studies. The studies were not very long because we hadn\u2019t had the vaccine for very long at that point, but even the longest ones being two months there was no decrease in the immune response at that two-month mark,\u201d she said. \u201cWe felt confident that we had a clear minimum of two months protection, a very strong likelihood a three-month protection, but we truly think it will probably last more like six months if we look at data from other vaccines and how long we see responses to them.\u201d However, Reimer says some Manitobans have got the virus after receiving the vaccine. \u201cWe have had individuals who have been infected with COVID after immunization,\u201d Reimer said. Epidemiologist Cynthia Carr says the vaccine trials were based on preventing severe outcomes of COVID-19, rather than stopping transmission. \u201cThe clinical trials did not address how effective the vaccine was in stopping the transmission of the disease in preventing asymptomatic or mild illness,\u201d Carr told Global News. \u201cIt was mostly based on very symptomatic, obvious illness, and the most severe outcomes.\u201d \u201cSo it would not be surprising, unfortunately, if someone who had their first dose could still become infected with COVID,\u201d she added. \u201cBut typically what happens, even if the vaccine is not 100 per cent effective against preventing symptomatic disease, it typically has efficacy in preventing the most severe outcomes. So you had that first dose, your immune system has learned something and it can react in a better way typically.\u201d Carr also says the vaccine affects people differently. \u201cOne size doesn\u2019t fit all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all have different immune systems and different risk and vulnerability. So again, a vaccine is not a treatment, a vaccine is a coach. It\u2019s teaching your body, teaching your immune system what to do. So if your immune system isn\u2019t good at communicating between the cells and reacting quickly and creating as much fighters as you need, you will have less protection.\u201d Public health officials are going to keep a close eye on what\u2019s rolling out in other jurisdictions. \u201cIf we see signs in any other jurisdiction that that immunity is going away, then we can start to move towards second doses for vulnerable Manitobans,\u201d Reimer said. \u201cFor today most jurisdictions are still seeing good protection after one dose. The best way for us to prevent this third wave or at least prevent it from being larger than it needs to be is to have as many people immune as possible. So even for those folks who have to wait for their second dose, they will be better protected if all the people around them have received a first dose.\u201d"},

{"title": "COMMENTARY: How Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines work - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted November 22, 2020 9:00 am", "body": "The COVID-19 pandemic has driven a massive allocation of resources toward producing solutions, from  , tracking   and ultimately to preventing infection with vaccines. As a physician scientist, I study how the virus has evolved over the pandemic, since any changes in the virus could also change the effectiveness of current treatments. On Nov. 9, Pfizer announced preliminary trial results showing that a vaccine it developed with BioNTech was about  . That was followed up nine days later with   and two months of safety data, indicating a 95 per cent effectiveness rate. Pfizer announced on Nov. 18 that it intends to file for emergency authorization with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Meanwhile, on Nov. 16,   for its own vaccine, developed with the U.S. National Institutes of Health, which also indicated effectiveness of about 95 per cent. This is good news, but we need to understand what it means so life can ultimately go back to normal. Both Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s vaccines are mRNA-based. In each of our cells, DNA produces messenger RNA (mRNA) containing the templates for making proteins. It\u2019s called messenger RNA because it carries that information to other parts of the cell, where the instructions are read and followed to produce specific proteins. When a patient is injected with mRNA in a vaccine, their cells use the information in that mRNA to create a protein: in this case, a version of the spike protein from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The immune system recognizes that protein as a signal to produce antibodies and immune cells. An  . It can produce robust immunity, can be made rapidly at low cost, and, like  , it is impossible for it to cause someone to develop the illness. This vaccine has the potential to protect many people from this devastating virus. When it is said that a vaccine is 90 per cent effective, this means that if 100 people received the vaccine and were then exposed to the virus, 90 would be unlikely to get sick. While 10 would be at risk of still developing the infection, protection from vaccines is not all-or-nothing. These 10 individuals could have milder disease than someone who did not receive the vaccine. It takes time for immune systems to prepare to fight infections. Think of building immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, as like preparing to run a marathon. First, the runner must register, just as the immune system must be exposed to the infectious agent. Then, they need to build stamina. For the immune system, this means making antibodies and immune cells. Finally, they run the marathon: the bolstered immune system now removes the infectious agent from the body, or prevents it from doing further damage. In both the   and  , subjects received the vaccine in two doses, three or four weeks apart, respectively. That\u2019s about how much time it takes for the stimulated immune system to produce meaningful protection. A booster vaccine was given to produce even more antibodies and immune cells. In terms of the marathon example, this is like doing a practice marathon around three weeks into training. The runner will do better than they would have on day one, but more training is likely still needed. The booster vaccine provides that extra training. Should we expect the pandemic to be over once a vaccine is available for public use? Not exactly. A vaccine will not be perfect, and it takes time for the immune system to be ready to protect us. In addition, it is possible that the vaccines will be less effective than cited. Clinical trials are carefully set up, but it is possible that the virus will have evolved enough since the vaccines were designed so they will provide less benefit. It will also take time for enough vaccine to be made and administered for the population to achieve  . Masks and social distancing will still most likely be necessary throughout 2021 because it takes time to accomplish such large-scale projects. We cannot expect   to get the world back to normal, even while neighbours are receiving vaccines. The human cost is unacceptable and the virus is too infectious for this to produce meaningful results unless  , with a lot of people dying up to that point and afterwards."},

I\u2019ve had several traumatic health-related episodes in my lifetime, but I\u2019m a healthy person and I think I maintain a level, calm head about things. After all, I\u2019ve worked in a newsroom for more than 20 years and you do need a thick skin most days. I\u2019m not overly concerned about  , but after two Global News colleagues tested positive for the virus in the last week (one of whom, I had several 15-minute-long meetings with) and after I began to experience a sore throat and runny nose, Toronto Public Health advised I get tested. I received the self-isolation email notice from Toronto Public Health on Sunday, but I had not left my house since Saturday. So Tuesday was my first outing and the destination was Michael Garron Hospital\u2019s COVID-19 assessment centre located in East York. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t I phoned the assessment centre on Monday and the soonest they could give me an appointment was Tuesday at 2:45 p.m., which seemed reasonable in my mind. I arrived on time and was greeted by a hospital security guard, outfitted in a face mask with plastic shield, gloves and a hospital gown overtop his security vest. He was sweating and visibly uncomfortable. He instructed me to take a face mask from the box sitting on top of the vestibule wall heater. \u201cWith my bare hands?\u201d I said as he pointed to the hand sanitizer, which I used before I pinched a face mask from the box. My cool demeanor was replaced with increasing anxiety the moment I entered the main waiting area. My eyes scanned the room and found the box of gloves I was looking for. I don\u2019t care how well adjusted you are \u2014 it\u2019s unnerving to be in a room with obviously sick people, all wearing masks and gloves. If I didn\u2019t already have COVID-19, would I get it here? Nobody wanted to touch anything or sit down, so it was reassuring to see a staff member whose only job was to constantly wipe down surfaces, chairs, door handles and ledges with disinfection wipes. Six of us were waiting to be tested and it was far less than what Monday offered, a woman I made polite conversation with told me. She told me she walked in and walked out on Monday because her anxiety couldn\u2019t handle the volume of people at the time of her initial appointment. When your name is called, you speak to the first of two intake workers who sit at computers behind the separation glass. The first person takes your health card and basic information, including your symptoms and recent travel history. The second person verifies that information while a nurse takes your vitals (blood pressure and temperature). It took well over 40 minutes for me to get to this point. Then there is more waiting before you enter the test rooms behind the double glass doors. While I wait, I watch the nurse carefully use disinfection wipes to clean the blood pressure pad, ear thermometer device and all of the electric cords attached. This is what I want to see. It\u2019s now approximately 4 p.m. and my private test room is available. After another 10 minutes, a doctor enters and again discusses the information I\u2019ve provided while making more notes. He explained the nasal swab will be \u201cunpleasant,\u201d but quick if I don\u2019t move. After another five minutes, a nurse enters with what looks like an extra-long, five-inch \u201cQ-tip\u201d-like swab she pulls out of a sealed package. Then, I\u2019m asked to lift my head up and in it goes. It\u2019s definitely not fun or comfortable, but fast. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Once the sample was taken, the swab was put into a sterile container holding a few millimetres of a fluid which helps to pull the cells off the swab. The plastic tube was sealed and sent off for testing. I received a phone call from Michael Garron Hospital on Friday telling me I tested negative for Covid-19. \u00a0The person went on to say that I would have to remain in self isolation for another 48 hours. Then I got a call from Toronto Public Health telling me this information was incorrect and that I needed to stay home as well as continuing to keep a safe distance from my family \u2014- for the rest of the 14 day period. This is because I\u2019m still considered to be in the \u201cincubation period.\u201d According to the World Health Organization, \u201cincubation period\u201d means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from one to 14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available."},

The letter is mainly signed by UCP backbenchers, although house speaker Nathan Cooper and former minister Tracy Allard, who lost her position in cabinet after vacationing in Hawaii over Christmas, are also on the list. That scandal also saw the resignation of MLA Jason Stephan \u2014 who signed the letter \u2014 from the treasury board.

I fully expect to hear some of those opinions publicly in the coming days,\u201d Kenney said while announcing the step backwards on Tuesday, adding he welcomes a wide-ranging debate on how best to rise to the challenge of this pandemic. \u201cI just ask that the debate be informed by facts.\u201d Opposition NDP health critic David Shepherd slammed the letter, saying it\u2019s not appropriate for any elected official to advocate for steps that would endanger the health and safety of others. \u201cFor these MLAs to suggest that this is the time to put their political fortunes ahead of the health and protection of Albertans, I think this is an incredibly disturbing thing to see. And that Premier Kenney has chosen to say, \u2018Well, this is just free speech, it\u2019s just a matter of opinion.\u2019 \u201cThis is not a matter of opinion. This is the very lives and livelihoods of hundreds of Albertans.\u201d Shepherd said Kenney\u2019s apparent acceptance of his party member\u2019s opposition to public health measures shows a lack of leadership. \u201c(Kenney) needs to put aside all of his dog whistling to extreme right and conspiracy theories that we\u2019ve seen from him over this last year, and he needs to make it clear that that will not be allowed in his caucus \u2013 those MLAs need to be removed.\u201d Kenney said Alberta is on track to have 2,000 new infections a day and 1,000 people in hospital with COVID-19 by the end of April. The province is now seeing a third wave of COVID-19, driven by variants, he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Kenney said he isn\u2019t surprised by the diversity of views on how to handle the pandemic, as we live in a society with a polarization of opinions. \u201cOn the one hand, we have some people who want what are called \u2018hard lockdowns\u2019 and have wanted those in a long-term basis, others who believe that the threat is massively exaggerated and we should have fewer, no restrictions. But Alberta\u2019s approach has been to find a sensible, safe middle ground \u2014 a common ground that can unite most Albertans.\u201d Kenney reiterated the province\u2019s goal from day one has been to control spread to prevent the health-care system from being overwhelmed, avoid large scale preventable deaths while minimizing the damage to the economy. \u201cFew decisions in this pandemic are easy decisions. Decisions can and do often have adverse effects. There\u2019s no sugar-coating that.\u201d Kenney said as much as he\u2019d like to stick to the plan, the government cannot ignore the science. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The Easter long weekend saw an average of about 1,000 new COVID-19 cases per day in the province. There were 931 new infections reported on Tuesday. About 43 per cent of Alberta\u2019s 10,000 active cases were the more contagious and potentially more dangerous variants. There were 328 people in hospital with the illness, including 76 in intensive care. The death toll in the province also surpassed 2,000 on Tuesday. \u201cWe cannot dismiss the medical advice and we cannot ignore the numbers. \u201cAs premier, I cannot in good conscience ignore the evidence and opt for a policy that could result in hundreds of preventable deaths.\u201d Barnes is asking for the premier and COVID cabinet committee to \u201cListen clearly to what 16 of us that represent an average of 40 or 45,000 people each are saying.\u201d Kenney said he understands people are tired more than a year into the pandemic, but we need to persevere through the next few months of getting people vaccinated.

Premier Jason Kenney provided more clarity on the dire threat the health crisis poses to the economy and how he plans to help citizens and companies already struggling with the financial fallout from the pandemic. \u201cThis public health crisis has been met by challenges\u2026 of an increasingly unprecedented proportion,\u201d he said in a speech he delivered at the Alberta legislature, noting the situation will lead to more \u201clost jobs and lost dreams.\u201d At a news conference on Wednesday, the province\u2019s chief medical officer of health, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, said she is well aware that the recommendations she makes to government on how to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus are having a massive impact on the economy. \u201cWe have had to weigh lives against livelihoods,\u201d she said. Hinshaw added there is a \u201cneed to respond to this extraordinary crisis with extraordinary kindness,\u201d not only to those who are sick, but also to people who have lost jobs or income as a result of the crisis. Hinshaw said Alberta has 22 new confirmed COVID-19 cases since a day earlier, when the province declared a public health emergency to deal with the situation. She said the total number of cases as of Wednesday afternoon is 119 and that there have been no deaths so far. Hinshaw said she suspects \u201csix of these cases are community transmission\u201d and that six patients are in hospital while all other cases involve people self-isolating at home. Of those COVID-19 cases resulting in hospitalizations, three are in intensive care units. She called these cases \u201cgame-changers.\u201d \u201cAlbertans will not be immune,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cThere will be fatalities.\u201d Hinshaw noted that while the health crisis continues to become more acute worldwide and at home, she has seen some things that have provided her with encouragement. She said the province\u2019s online assessment tool for people who are experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 has been accessed 1.5 million times. She said 15,000 tests have been administered in the province, and she believes that amounts to more tests per capita than anywhere else in North America. Hinshaw said several of the province\u2019s most recent cases involved travellers who were returning home. She said in these cases, the travellers followed health officials\u2019 advice and immediately self-isolated, called Health Link and got tested. She said their actions saw them limit the potential of exposure to others. Of the   cases in AB:  24 are from the US 8 are from Mexico 7 are from Germany 7 are from the UK \u2014 Julia Wong (@JWongGlobalNews)  \u201cThank you,\u201d Hinshaw said, while speaking about people following health guidelines during the pandemic. \u201cYour actions are life-saving for others.\u201d \u201cWe will get through this together.\u201d On Tuesday, Health Link received 10,800 calls. Hinshaw again spoke of cases of COVID-19 that have been linked to the Pacific Dental Conference in Vancouver earlier this month. She said seven Alberta cases are connected to that event and that all people should \u201cself-isolate immediately, even if feeling well\u201d for 14 days from when they left the conference. Hinshaw said there have been two COVID-19 cases in Calgary and one in Edmonton that have left health officials with questions as they are not sure where the contracted the illness. \u201cThis is concerning,\u201d Hinshaw said. Of the COVID-19 cases in Alberta, 83 are in the Calgary zone, 27 are in the Edmonton zone, four are in the North zone, three are in the Central zone and two are in the South zone. Hinshaw said she and her colleagues believe the numbers are higher in the Calgary area, in part, because of how many people travel to that city. Unlike in some other provinces, Alberta continues to allow visitors to hospitals if they meet certain requirements. When asked why the province is not restricting access further, Hinshaw said health officials are \u201ctrying to balance the needs of patients\u2026 with limiting infection.\u201d On Wednesday evening, Alberta Health Services tweeted that effective immediately, hospitals in the province will only allow one visitor at a time in order to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 and to protect patients. AHS added that children will no longer be allowed to visit hospitals because they may not show COVID-19 symptoms, which presents an extra degree of risk to hospital staff and patients. However, the authority said exceptions to that rule will be considered on a case-by-case basis. These restrictions are in addition to visits being barred from people who are feeling unwell, have a compromised immune system, are in self-isolation for COVID-19 or are being tested for COVID-19.

Let\u2019s hope we reach the peak earlier and it affects fewer people than we are projecting. \u201cBut to be realistic, based on the velocity of this disease around the world, we can expect this to pose a very real threat to public safety for at least the next two or three months.\u201d In the Alberta legislature on Wednesday, Kenney delivered a speech to MLAs in which he underscored how devastating the COVID-19 pandemic has been for the province\u2019s already battered economy. \u201cWe are facing a period of profound adversity,\u201d he said, adding it had been nearly a century since Alberta\u2019s economy has faced such staggering challenges. He noted the price of West Texas Intermediate oil had dropped to $21 per barrel and that Western Canadian Select was at $9 and could plunge even lower. \u201cAlbertans are doing their part to keep each other safe and prevent the spread of COVID-19,\u201d the premier said in a news release. \u201cWe are doing ours by assisting Albertans and their families, protecting jobs and supporting workers and employers. \u201cWe will help shelter Albertans from the economic disruption of COVID-19 now, and position Alberta\u2019s industry and businesses to bounce back when the situation stabilizes. \u201cThis is an initial set of measures, and more will follow in the days to come.\u201d Kenney announced his government will make $50 million available for \u201cemergency isolation support,\u201d a temporary program through which working, adult citizens \u201cwho must self-isolate because they meet the government of Alberta\u2019s published criteria for self-isolation\u201d can apply for a one-time payment until federal emergency payments are sent out next month. The Alberta government said the payments will be $573 per week for the two weeks between now and when the federal benefits kick in, for a total of $1,146. Kenney said those who feel they may qualify can apply on alberta.ca next week and that a payment will be deposited into their accounts soon after if they are approved. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Kenney also announced utility protection for citizens and businesses, meaning they can defer bill payments for 90 days without having essential services cut off. He said that step covers electricity and natural gas and that he is  for water bills. Students will be able to take advantage of a six-month, interest-free moratorium on provincial student loan payments, the government announced. This measure is aimed at students already in the process of paying loans off. Personal banking customers at ATB Financial will be able to apply for up to six months of deferrals on loans with that institution as well as mortgages. People who bank with Alberta credit unions will be able to access programs and initiatives aimed at solving loan payment and cash flow issues resulting from the health crisis. Meanwhile, Kenney said his government will defer the collection of corporate income tax balances and instalment payments (due after Wednesday) until Aug. 31. He said this measure would free up about $1.5 billion for companies grappling with how to deal with the financial fallout of the pandemic. The premier said individual Albertans will also be able to defer provincial income taxes. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Before Wednesday, Alberta\u2019s UCP government had already announced $500 million in supplemental health-care funding to help those on the front lines deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. The government had also earlier pledged to spend $60 million \u201cto support seniors and other vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by COVID-19.\u201d This is in addition to community and social services funds allocated in the most recent budget. Opposition Leader Rachel Notley responded to Kenney\u2019s speech and said she was pleased to see some of the steps the premier was taking. She noted she was still concerned about elements of the budget passed on Tuesday, especially the level of health funding it includes. Notley said even with mortgage deferrals and utility protection, many Albertans will struggle in the coming months. She also noted the province would need to take further action to diversify its economy to help strengthen it."},

The province expects to administer 36,594 doses in clinics this week. In a Tuesday update, the province said Phase 1 of its vaccine rollout is around 50 per cent completed and is on track to be done by the end of April. Phase 1 included the following priority groups: Public Health has said its goal is to vaccinate Nova Scotians as quickly and as efficiently as possible, which is also why the province will be sticking with an aged-based approach. Phase 2 is expected to begin in April, when all priority groups, including those over 75 years old, are expected to be vaccinated. By mid-May, the province said it is expecting to have all of its clinics running at full capacity, being able to deliver 86,000 doses weekly. Nova Scotia expects to have 70 per cent of its vaccine supply administered through pharmacies and primary care clinics. Community clinics are expected to deliver 29 per cent of the doses and one per cent will be administered through mobile clinics."},

According to medical experts, the vaccine seems to trigger antibodies directed against platelets, the sticky blood cells forming clots. \u201cThese clots tend to occur in unusual areas, like the brain or the gut, and they also tend to be quite aggressive,\u201d Dr. Menaka Pai, Hamilton hematologist and thrombosis medicine physician, told Global News. \u201cSo these antibodies attack the person\u2019s platelets\u2026 They switch them on and they cause blood clotting,\u201d said Pai. However, Lauren was not aware of her exact situation until her boyfriend sent her a screenshot of a news report concerning blood clots caused by the AstraZeneca vaccine. As of April 4, 34 million vaccine doses have been administered in Britain and the European Economic Area over the past three months. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said its vaccine side effects monitoring system had received 169 reports of cases of CVST, or s in vessels exiting the brain, and 53 cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), or ting in veins in the abdomen. The EMA\u2019s safety committee carried out a review of 62 cases of CVST, and 24 cases of SVT, of which 18 were fatal. Most cases occurred within two weeks of the person receiving their first dose, and most of the cases reported in Europe have occurred in women under 60, like Lauren. Though the European Medicines Agency ruled last week that it found a \u201cpossible link\u201d between the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine and a blood clotting disorder, they have maintained that the instances have been extremely rare. Several experts have also said that the risks of clotting are higher from common medications, such as birth control and hormone replacement therapy, during pregnancy, from long trips and due to smoking, rather then the COVID-19 vaccines themselves. \u201cBlood clots are more common with just day-to-day living than they are with any of the vaccines, including the AstraZeneca and the Johnson & Johnson,\u201d Linda Dresser, an infectious diseases expert and assistant professor at the University of Toronto, told Global News. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the likelihood of developing   is three to nine women out of 10,000, every year. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), on the other hand, holds that   when compared to women who are not pregnant. According to Ben Chan, assistant professor of global health at the University of Toronto, the likelihood of getting blood clots from the AstraZeneca vaccine are \u201cequivalent to the risk of being hit by a car and dying in Toronto in a given year.\u201d \u201cYes, these are risks, we should be aware of them, but we need to put them into perspective compared to the daily risks that we have in our lives around us,\u201d he told Global News in an interview."},

New Brunswick\u2019s first allotment of the Pfizer-BioNTech   for COVID-19 came in 1,950 doses \u2014 all of which will be given out this weekend. McGrath says about 150 health-care staff will work 12-hours a day on Saturday and Sunday, in what she calls a \u201cfantastic effort.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Eighty-four-year-old Pauline Gauvin, a resident of Shannex Losier Hall, was the first to receive the vaccine on Saturday. \u201cIt was an honour,\u201d she said Saturday morning. \u201cThis is something I won\u2019t forget.\u201d Gauvin said she didn\u2019t feel much and felt comfortable when she received the injection. Others on the list to get the first vaccinations include: Dr. Boucher said every health worker\u2019s nightmare is getting infected with COVID-19 and bringing the virus into their communities. With the vaccine, he says these fears will now start to go away for him. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing you can be sure that once you\u2019re vaccinated it\u2019s going to help,\u201d Boucher said. \u201cWe have a duty as health-care workers to show the way, and actually promote that we believe in science, we believe in this vaccine and there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.\u201d Miramichi was chosen because \u201cit is central to the north and to the south of New Brunswick,\u201d McGrath said in the Saturday briefing. \u201cIf you are a health-care provider and you work in an ICU or an ER, or a COVID unit, you are coming from every hospital in the province today.\u201d Another reason Miramichi was chosen was the location of the freezer. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine must be kept at -70 C, according to Pfizer. New Brunswick has accepted an offer from a bluefin tuna exporting company in eastern P.E.I. to loan two freezers to store the vaccine. Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said the provider of the vaccine is recommending the vaccine not be moved to different sites. But, this could change within the next three months. With the Pfizer vaccine, common side effects are pain at the injection site, fatigue and muscle aches and pains. Russell said some may experience a fever too. The federal government also announced on Tuesday that it has secured 168,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine that should arrive before the end of December. However, that is contingent on approval from Health Canada. Russell said Saturday that surveys in New Brunswick show about 75 per cent of residents are \u201ckeen to get the vaccine.\u201d The province said half, or 1,950, of the 3,900 doses arriving next week will be held until the weekend of Jan. 9, 2021 to serve as the second dose of the vaccine for those receiving the vaccine this weekend. The other half will be used to administer two doses to an additional 975 people in New Brunswick. \u201cThis is just the very first step, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket, but it\u2019s getting the ball rolling,\u201d Russell said."},

But at that time, the number of active cases across the province was much lower than it is now. Over about two weeks in July, the number of daily active COVID-19 cases in Alberta rose from 584 to 1,293. On Oct. 26, there were a total of 4,477 active cases across the province. Dr. Deena Hinshaw said Alberta confirmed 572 COVID-19 cases on Saturday and 504 cases on Sunday. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t This month, in October, the province has about 800 contact tracers \u2014 including full time, part time, redeployed and casual staff \u2014 and it wants to hire more. AHS is aiming to soon have a total of about 1,180 contact tracers. \u201cAHS has posted positions and hired new staff for the team, in addition to redeployment from within our own health system,\u201d AHS spokesperson James Wood told Global News on Oct. 27. \u201cWe continue to review our staffing numbers to ensure we have the support required to meet increasing demands.\u201d During a news conference on Oct. 26, Hinshaw explained the job gets harder as case counts rise. \u201cOne of the challenges of rising cases is that it creates pressure on certain key elements of our COVID-19 response, including contact tracing. We have been working with AHS on new strategies to more effectively and efficiently notify close contacts of confirmed cases of COVID-19. \u201cRight now, AHS has more than 800 staff on its contact tracing team,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cAHS is increasing their staffing as quickly as possible, and they are actively recruiting more people to meet these increasing demands.\u201d In an effort to get information to Albertans more quickly, the province\u2019s top doctor said event organizers are now being asked to help notify potentially infected guests. \u201cIf a positive case attended an event while infectious, AHS will now notify the organizer and provide them with written notification that can be directly emailed to all event attendees. We will be asking event organizers to send these emails within 24 hours of being contacted by AHS. \u201cThis change will make the close contact notification process quicker for large events,\u201d she said. AHS will continue to make notification phone calls if an event organizer can\u2019t handle the rapid email notification process. \u201cAHS will also continue to directly notify close contacts of cases who were exposed outside of any public or private event and will continue to directly contact anyone who tests positive for COVID-19,\u201d Hinshaw said. The process of contact tracing involves phoning a positive case, identifying close contacts and following up with those individuals in the hopes of limiting further transmission. Early in the pandemic, it took Alberta workers about six-and-a-half hours to contact trace a confirmed case, Dr. Kristin Klein, medical officer of health with the communicable disease control team at AHS, told Global News on July 24. The goal was 24 hours. But as case numbers in the province and the number of close contacts per case rose, it took longer \u2014 sometimes several days. \u201cWhat helps our team is when people keep that circle small and they can easily tell us who they\u2019ve been around,\u201d Klein explained. Albertans can help by keeping lists of close contacts. Some are proactively notifying family and friends of positive test results. \u201cThat does get people staying home earlier and then we are just a confirmation call, basically,\u201d explained Angela Jacobs, AHS\u2019 notifiable disease program associate manager. Some businesses are asking for contact information at the door. \u201cFor employees, that\u2019s a fairly easy thing for businesses to do. For customer and public individuals who might be accessing services, it might be a little more difficult,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cThe best thing we can do as a community is to physical distance, wear those masks, follow the guidelines, wash your hands.\u201d While there are delays in contact tracing, Alberta is not in the same position as Toronto, where some contact tracing has stopped altogether as a result of increasing pressures. \u201cWe certainly haven\u2019t reached that point in Alberta, where that decision is being made, but there\u2019s always people evaluating,\u201d Jacobs said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t NDP Leader Rachel Notley says a recent Harvard University study recommends a ratio of tracers to population that would mean about 1,300 tracers for Alberta. \u201cIf we had more contact tracers, and if we were able to have faster turnaround on testing, we\u2019d have a better idea of where to take targeted action,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cRight now, I would say, quite frankly, the indication that I get is that to some degree we\u2019re flying a bit blind.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Notley also wants to see the national contact tracing app launched in Alberta. The Opposition leader said the NDP isn\u2019t sure if the holdup is a political one or a technical one.

Coronaviruses, he explains, have long been a problem for animals, but have only emerged as a big problem for humans in the last 20 or so years. He said contributing factors include more human travel than ever, more people living in cities and more people interacting with wildlife. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Part of the solution could come from better funding for viral research in animals, Abrahamyan believes. \u201cTo me, it became clear a long time ago we need added funding in animal pathogens, because most emerging diseases are of zoonotic origin,\u201d he explained. Abrahamyan also wanted to elaborate on why officials are emphasizing the importance of hand-washing, explaining that viruses are protected by a thin, vulnerable membrane. \u201cThat membrane is too sensitive to humidity, temperature, detergents, alcohols, etc.,\u201d he explained, adding that cells near your eyes, nose and mouth are particularly vulnerable to viruses.

At a news conference in Edmonton, Dr. Deena Hinshaw said about 368,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the province to date, with Alberta still in Phase 2A of its rollout plan. Once 2A is complete, the province\u2019s top doctor said Alberta will continue to focus on people most at risk of severe outcome from COVID-19 because of \u201climited supply\u201d of the vaccine. \u201cI know many Albertans have been anxiously waiting to see if their conditions will be eligible,\u201d Hinshaw acknowledged. \u201cI appreciate their patience.\u201d In Phase 2B, Albertans born between 1957 and 2005 who live with what Alberta Health describes as certain \u201chigh-risk underlying health conditions\u201d will be eligible for the vaccine. Hinshaw said as long as there is no supply shortage, health authorities expect Phase 2B to begin in April. Among the health conditions that make Albertans eligible in Phase 2B are congenital heart disease, chronic heart failure, chronic respiratory disease, chronic kidney diseases, certain chronic neurological diseases, diabetes that requires medication as well as people undergoing chemotherapy or treatment for HIV.

All of these conditions are associated with a higher risk of death or hospitalization, even in younger age groups, when comparing their risks to those people aged 50 to 64 with no underlying conditions. These conditions are complex and every patient is unique.\u201d Hinshaw said the province plans to use the honour system so that people who are eligible for vaccination in Phase 2A will not be required to prove they have one of the medical conditions listed. She noted that like in Phase 2A, people eligible to be vaccinated in Phase 2B will be able to book their appointments through pharmacies or through Alberta Health Services when their birth year becomes eligible. Hinshaw also outlined who will be eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine shot in Phase 2C, once Phase 2B is complete. Phase 2C will see health-care workers working in patient care facilities or providing direct patient care in the community become eligible for vaccination. \u201cProtecting health-care workers who have been caring for COVID-19 patients for more than a year provides protection to every patient accessing care across the health-care system,\u201d Hinshaw said.

While the couple is feeling relieved and lucky, they are also anxious about the long wait until July before they can get their second dose. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cIt is concerning. We would feel better protected and more confident if we were able to get the second dose sooner than the four months,\u201d said Walmsley, a 60-year-old from Coaldale, a town about 230 km south of Calgary. On March 3, Canada\u2019s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI)  , recommending provinces and territories extend the time between first and second\u00a0  vaccine doses to four months, from the originally mandated span of three to four weeks, amid vaccine shortages. NACI said extending the dosing interval will help \u201copportunities for protection of the entire adult population within a short timeframe.\u201d The governments of  , Alberta,   and Manitoba have made the switch for their rollout plans outside of the long-term care settings. But many experts say that elderly adults, as well as the vulnerable population, who have a weaker immune response, should be exempted from this rule. \u201cOlder people\u2026 have the weakest immune systems amongst us and COVID-19 preys on that,\u201d said Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Sinai Health and University Health Network hospitals in Toronto. \u201cThis \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach to delaying the second dose of the vaccine by up to 16 weeks may not be right for everyone.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The concerns stem from   coming out of the United Kingdom \u2013 where both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines are being given 12 weeks apart \u2013 that suggests that the second dose is crucial to get the full benefit of the vaccine for the elderly population. Looking at the scientific evidence, the first dose wanes much faster compared to the two doses, said Jorgan Fritz, an immunologist at McGill University. The waning is \u201cclearly high\u201d in the elderly and immunosuppressed individuals, he told Global News. \u201cThe worry of the scientific community is that we are vaccinating without creating an efficacious immune response by doing this increased spacing of the two doses,\u201d Fritz said. Vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna propose intervals of 21 and 28 days, respectively. The protocol for giving the booster shot set and used in the clinical trials for AstraZeneca was one month after the first dose. In a statement to Global News, Health Canada said: \u201cNACI is monitoring the evidence on effectiveness of an extended dose interval, including in specific populations.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In the coming weeks, the committee will review the extended interval strategy, it added. Derek Phillips, an 82-year-old from Toronto, Ont., got his first dose of the Moderna vaccine at Seneca College last Saturday. He said he was taken aback when he was told his appointment for the second dose would be after 14 weeks and not four weeks as indicated on the pamphlet from the provincial health department. When he questioned the change in the timeline, a woman at the vaccination site said \u2018we might call you earlier,\u2019 Phillips said. His main concern is getting the \u201coptimum medical benefit.\u201d I don\u2019t think there should be any uncertainty,\u201d the dual U.K.-Canadian citizen added. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d Tania Watts, an immunologist and professor at the University of Toronto, said the delay in those aged 80 and above is \u201cmore risky\u201d than the delay for younger people. \u201cSo while everyone benefits from boosting the immune system with a second dose, the delay is more serious in those at greater risk, such as cancer patients, older people, the immunocompromised,\u201d she told Global News. Meanwhile,  , although rare, is a concern for seniors. A large-scale peer-reviewed   published in the Lancet medical journal on March 17 found that most people who have had COVID-19 are protected from catching it again for at least six months, but elderly patients above 65 are more prone to reinfection than younger people. Earlier in March, an outbreak at a Gatineau, Que., long-term care home, where 96 per cent of the residents and 41 per cent of staff had been vaccinated with a first dose,  . In Canada, the 60-plus population accounts for more than 95 per cent of COVID-19 deaths. \u201cIf the goal is to save the most lives possible, then we would consider shortening that second interval,\u201d said Sinha. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The spread of more transmissible variants has also   about vaccine effectiveness, with   showing reduced antibody protection. In addition to a tight adherence to the dose regimen recommended and used in clinical trials by the vaccine makers, Fritz said the elderly and vulnerable people should also get a booster shot starting in November to ensure \u201cbest immune protection\u201d for the winter. \u201cThere is the fear that a suboptimal immune response could lead to increased occurrence of viral variants,\u201d he said."},

At Tuesday\u2019s press briefing, Dr. Robert Strang said the map will show the four health zones of Nova Scotia and numbers of cases that are in each health zone. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to do that until we had at least five cases in each of those zones,\u201d Strang said. \u201cThat\u2019s a standard epidemiologic principle that you don\u2019t talk about less than five cases.\u201d He said there have been technical issues with getting the map on the government website, but it\u2019s coming soon. The province announced 20 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, bringing Nova Scotia\u2019s total to 147. Five additional cases were announced Monday. Four individuals are currently in hospital and 10 have now recovered. One case of community spread has been confirmed.

NSGEU president Jason MacLean said that the individual did not work directly with patients at the facility. The Nova Scotia Health Authority isn\u2019t providing details about what roles or facilities the employees worked in, but said Monday that three are in the central zone, which includes Halifax, while the fourth is in the eastern zone, which includes Cape Breton, Antigonish, and Guysborough. The four employees are in self-isolation, along with their close contacts. The NSHA has not said how many close contacts are away from work awaiting tests.

{"title": "Alberta enacts 2nd COVID-19 state of public health emergency. Here\u2019s what it means  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted November 24, 2020 11:55 am", "body": "Alberta is in a second state of public of health emergency as of Tuesday, after\u00a01,115 new\u00a0  cases were confirmed in the last 24 hours. New targeted restrictions were also introduced Tuesday based on the recommendations chief medical officer of health Dr. Deena Hinshaw presented to cabinet in an eight-hour session on Monday. The measures will be in effect for three weeks and re-evaluated after that. \u201cThese mandatory measures will place new restrictions on social gatherings, worship services, businesses, schools and all Albertans,\u201d Premier   said, adding the restrictions weren\u2019t determined lightly. \u201cWe believe these are the minimum restrictions needed right now to safeguard our health-care system, while avoiding widespread damage to peoples\u2019 livelihood.\u201d The first new restriction is aimed at social gatherings, and prohibits any indoor social gathering in any setting, and outdoor gatherings are limited to 10 people, effective immediately. \u201cSocial gatherings are the biggest problem,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cIt is the key reason why COVID-19 is winning. These gatherings in the home continue to be the largest form of transmission.\u201d People who live alone are allowed to have two \u201cclose contacts\u201d who they can socialize with, as long as you are each others\u2019 close contacts. No more than 10 people can be present at wedding and funeral ceremonies as of Tuesday, and receptions are also off limits. \u201cFor those grieving, I know this is a particular sacrifice,\u201d Kenney said, acknowledging that the emotional nature of both funerals and weddings make them higher risk for transmission of COVID-19. Festivals and events are also prohibited under the state of public health emergency, and people are encouraged to work from home if possible. Masks were made mandatory in workplaces in the hotspots of Calgary and Edmonton, and their surrounding areas. Kenney said despite the vast majority of faith communities following the province\u2019s public health guidelines, some groups have flagrantly ignored them, leading to outbreaks. As a result, attendance at places of worship is being capped at one-third a building\u2019s fire code capacity, while also requiring masks and physical distancing between households. \u201cWe will enforce these rules against indoor social gatherings and those who break these rules will be subject to fines,\u201d Kenney said, adding the government is exploring ways to allow peace officers to deliver those fines. The fines could range anywhere from $1,000 to $100,000. Kenney also said an Alberta Emergency Alert will be sent to all Albertans this week to make sure everyone is aware of the restrictions. \u201cI never imagined\u2026 I\u2019d be in a place where I\u2019d be telling people who can come into their house. We just felt like we really had no other options.\u201d How students learn will change, beginning next Monday. \u201cRising cases in our workplaces and homes, driven disproportionately by the social gatherings, means that we are seeing rising cases in schools as well,\u201d Kenney said, reiterating there is little evidence of transmission in schools. Kenney said the cases in schools has put a strain on staffing, negatively impacting the quality of education Alberta\u2019s students are getting. Schools across the province are also moving to online learning until the new year \u2013 with Grades 7 to 12 starting at-home learning as early as Nov. 30. Kenney said teenagers pose a higher risk of virus transmission, which is why officials are mandating a longer pause from classroom learning for older students. Students in Kindergarten to Grade 6, and early childhood learning, will begin online learning on Dec. 18. until their winter break begins. Keeping younger students in schools for longer also offers parents, and daycares, a break when it comes to caring for young children. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t All students will be out of the classrooms until Jan. 11, 2021. The decision to extend the winter break is so any students who have been around family during the holidays will have a window to monitor for symptoms before returning to class. Diploma exams were also made optional for the rest of the school year, meaning students can choose to write them, or be exempt from the April, June and August 2021 examinations. More restrictions are also coming to the hospitality and fitness industries, with restaurants, bars, pubs and coffee shops now only allowed to seat people from the same household, to a maximum of six people. \u201cRetail businesses and services may remain open, but will be restricted to 25 per cent of occupancy limits,\u201d Kenney said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The 10 p.m. limit on liquor service and 11 p.m. closure rules   will remain in place. Health Minister Tyler Shandro said health inspections will be increased to ensure establishments are following the health measures, and those that aren\u2019t complying may be fined. Businesses like hair salons, personal wellness services and hotels can still operate, but on an appointment-only basis and all patrons and service providers must comply with existing health measures. As of Friday, banquet halls, conference centres and concert venues will be closed temporarily to any in-person service. Sport leagues are also impacted, but can apply for exemptions, Kenney said, if they have \u201cwell-developed COVID safety plans.\u201d Kenney said in recent weeks, as many as nine outbreaks have been traced back to amateur sports games. Gyms and fitness centres can remain open for people exercising individually, operating at 25 per cent capacity. If Alberta\u2019s COVID-19 numbers don\u2019t improve, the government will look at bringing stricter measures \u201clikely in three weeks\u2019 time.\u201d Kenney apologized for the government\u2019s \u201cstupid\u201d mistake in the spring with its \u201carbitrary distinction between essential and non-essential retail businesses.\u201d \u201c[The distinction] had the unintended consequence of allowing Walmarts and Costcos to sell darn near everything because they have a grocery section or they sell pharmaceuticals, while shutting down thousands and thousands of retail small- and medium-sized businesse.\u201d \u201cWe are putting a capacity limit because we have to do some things to limit general social and community transmission.\u201d As of Tuesday, Alberta had 13,349 active cases of COVID-19. Hinshaw said the new case number is lower than recent daily totals, but said \u201cthis dip is due to fewer tests,\u201d with about 13,500 tests completed on Monday, compared to more than 19,000 on Sunday. The province\u2019s test positivity rate was 8.3 per cent as of Tuesday. Alberta\u2019s death toll also rose to 492 on Tuesday, as 16 more people sick with COVID-19 died since Monday. Three-hundred-forty-eight people were being treated in hospital for COVID-19 Tuesday, with 66 needing ICU care. The majority of Tuesday\u2019s deaths were in the Edmonton Zone, with six people \u2013 a woman in her 70s, two women in their 90s and three men in their 90s \u2013 dying after contracting the virus at South Terrace Continuing Care in the Edmonton Zone. Two men in their 80s died in the last 24 hours, one connected to the outbreak at Capital Care Lynwood in the Edmonton Zone and the other linked to the Royal Alexandra Hospital outbreak. Two people linked to the outbreak at the Rosealta Lodge in the Central Zone also passed away; a man in his 90s and a woman in her 100s. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The remaining deaths were all in the Edmonton Zone and were not linked to outbreaks, and included two men in their 70s, a woman in her 60s, two men in their 60s and a woman in her 100s. The Opposition issued a news release following Kenney\u2019s news conference and called the government\u2019s new COVID-19 restrictions \u201ca small package of half-measures.\u201d Opposition Leader Rachel Notley said she expected stronger action from the premier. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is simply not enough,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the product of political bargaining inside the UCP and not the product of a serious engagement with public health advice. \u201cThese half-measures will mean prolonging the pandemic, prolonging the suffering, and prolonging the economic pain.\u201d The NDP said the new measures don\u2019t amount to any \u201cmeaningful changes\u201d when it comes to shops, restaurants and bars and noted that for the most part, in the areas where the province is now making masks mandatory, face covering bylaws are already in effect and said Alberta remains the only province in Canada without a province-wide mask policy. \u201cToday, Jason Kenney had one last chance to make the hard choice,\u201d Notley said. \u201cHe failed to do so, and now we all have to live with the consequences.\u201d"},

Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon specified that businesses applying for assistance will not only have to show a causal link to the coronavirus pandemic but also show profitability after. \u201cThe government will be offering loans and loan guarantees of a minimum of $50,000 and very advantageous rates,\u201d he said. While he admitted the government won\u2019t be able to save all businesses the program will go a long way to help. He also didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of adding more money to the program if need be. On Monday, the Quebec government rolled out a new temporary program to financially support workers who are not eligible for other income replacement programs and who are affected by containment measures. Legault said all Quebecers can do their part to help the struggling economy by buying locally, even when purchasing online. Earlier in the day, the premier urged people to stay at home and limit travel between regions as the number of confirmed cases of novel   jumped to 121 on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s not time to be in shopping centres. It\u2019s not the time to spend an hour and a half at restaurants,\u201d Legault said.. There are seven people who are hospitalized due to  , the disease caused by the virus. As of Thursday, about 4,000 people are awaiting test results and nearly 6,000 individuals have been given the all clear. So far, the health crisis has led to one death in the province. The victim was an elderly woman who had contact with travellers. The healthcare system is ready to administer at least 5,000 tests per day as of Thursday, according to Legault. He also wants to assure Quebecers that there is no shortage of masks or respirators in hospitals and clinics. \u201cWe have all the equipment we need,\u201d he said. Quebec municipalities are asked to cancel or postpone meetings and consultations that require the presence of citizens amid the outbreak. Municipal Affairs Minister Andr\u00e9e Laforest issued the request on Thursday in a bid to contain the spread of COVID-19. Over the past week, the province has rolled out expansive measures to address the pandemic including closing schools, banning large indoor gatherings and asking seniors to stay home. While people have been asked to limit their contact with others, the director of Quebec public health said it is the time to do things you enjoy while avoiding crowds. \u201cTake advantage of the things you love to do and never have the time to do on your own,\u201d said Dr. Horacio Arruda. Arruda, for his part, said he took the time to cook new recipes while practicing social-distancing measures on the weekend. \u201cTransform this into something positive,\u201d he said. As cases spike, unions representing construction workers are calling on the province to temporarily close work sites. In a letter, FTQ Construction and the Conseil provincial du Qu\u00e9bec des m\u00e9tiers de la construction say Legault must act now to protect employees. They say in their letter that the hygiene measures recommended to counter the spread of the virus \u201care not used on construction sites,\u201d which makes workers vulnerable. The demand comes as the province has shut down schools and non-essential services in a bid to contain the virus. Under the government\u2019s guidelines, workers who are able to work from home have been asked to do so."},

And as a result of that, what we do is we end up in a situation where the more time goes on, the more worried we get \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u00a0 As well, even though 59 per cent say they would support mandatory vaccination, more than 70 per cent also say they feel nervous about taking a vaccine that was created and rolled out so quickly. Sixty-nine per cent also cite the potential for long-term effects as a major concern. \u201cUntil people actually get experience with a vaccine and they see what the effects have been on other people, and they\u2019ve had a lot of reassurance from people that they trust, they\u2019re going to be reluctant,\u201d Bricker said. \u201cWe see that reluctance start to grow, mostly because we\u2019re getting closer to when a vaccine is probably going to be available.\u201d Coronavirus cases have been spiking across the country in recent weeks as the second wave of the pandemic tightens its grip, leading to mounting cases around the world. Public health officials in Canada are urging people to stay home, limit their contacts as much as possible to their own household, and avoid any non-essential outings. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Prime Minister   has warned the winter will be difficult as Canadians increasingly battle the mental health effects of nine months of isolation, economic uncertainty and shattered life plans. Promising announcements from two frontrunners in the hunt for a vaccine have sparked hope that the roll-out of the first doses from   and Moderna could happen between January and March. While Trudeau says the majority of Canadians should be able to get vaccinated by September 2021, those initial limited doses will go to top priority groups such as front-line workers and high-risk people. But while the polling shows Canadians are broadly united in the belief that front-line health workers and first responders should get the first doses, that consensus begins to break down around which groups of Canadians should get it next. Ipsos asked respondents to pick from a list of 20 categories of people and say which five should get the shot first: front-line health workers and first responders were the only ones to get majority support with 62 per cent and 52 per cent agreeing those Canadians should be first in line. From there, though, there appears to be a range of support for who should go next. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Just under half (49 per cent) said seniors should go next, followed by long-term care home staff at 46 per cent, those with pre-existing conditions at 34 per cent and other essential workers at 24 per cent. School teachers and staff came next at 20 per cent support, followed by 18 per cent support for \u201canybody who wants one\u201d being able to go next. Bricker said the findings also showed that after support for front-line health workers and first responders going first, respondents were most likely to say that people who are similar to the respondents should get to go next. \u201cSo, for example, boomers would say boomers (should get it next), Gen Z people would say Gen Z, women would say women,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of an indirect way of saying, \u2018Once we\u2019ve taken care of the people that everybody regards as essential, if I can be reassured that it\u2019s OK for me, I want to be in first.\u201d And despite the broad concerns about the safety of the vaccine, a majority of Canadians say they believe vaccine regulators at Health Canada will do their jobs. Fifty-seven per cent say they are confident once one is approved, it will be \u201ccompletely safe.\u201d"},

{"title": "Coronavirus vaccine makers are shielded from liability. Here\u2019s why officials say that\u2019s normal - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted December 14, 2020 2:54 pm", "body": "The government has confirmed that     manufacturers are protected from liability when it comes to issues with their doses \u2014 but the feds say this is par-for-the-course and has no bearing on vaccine safety. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear that indemnification clauses in vaccine contracts are standard,\u201d Procurement Minister   told reporters, speaking at a Monday press conference in Ottawa. \u201cAll countries, generally speaking, are faced with the issue of indemnification of companies, especially in cases of novel technologies like this.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t When pressed on whether Canada is including these indemnification clauses as part of the contracts that have been drawn up with vaccine manufacturers, Anand confirmed that this is the case. \u201cYes we are, and we are definitely not any different than any other country in this world,\u201d Anand explained. Her comments are in line with government and public health positions that pre-date the pandemic. In a Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) document that lays out planning guidance for vaccines in the event of a pandemic, the agency recommends using indemnity clauses to keep the inoculation process moving. \u201cTo prevent delays in release of the vaccine at time of pandemic, the pandemic vaccine supply contract stipulates that the Government of Canada will indemnify the manufacturer against any claims or lawsuits brought against it by third parties,\u201d the document reads. That document is from 2017, and was most recently updated in September 2019. This removal of liability for vaccine manufacturers is an issue that has taken centre stage in some anti-vaccination circles, where individuals cite this lack of liability as a key source of their vaccine hesitancy. The latest incarnation of this argument was seen in an e-petition sponsored by Conservative MP Derek Sloan. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t That e-petition, which calls into question vaccine safety and has been condemned by Health Minister Patty Hajdu, claims that \u201cCOVID-19 vaccine manufacturers are being granted legal immunity\u201d and cites this as a chief concern driving their call for the vaccine to be voluntary \u2014 something that is already the case in Canada. Global News contacted PHAC to ask about this indemnity last week. While the agency wouldn\u2019t provide details of its contracts with manufacturers at that time, they did emphasize the safety of any vaccine that is approved in Canada. \u201cHealth Canada is committed to protecting the health and safety of Canadians and has a rigorous scientific review system in place to ensure vaccines are safe and effective in preventing the diseases they target,\u201d read the emailed statement from PHAC. \u201cOnce a vaccine is authorized for sale, manufacturers are required to continue submitting information on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and monitor and communicate any potential adverse events following immunization. Health Canada will not hesitate to take action if a safety issue is identified.\u201d Officials from Health Canada have echoed these reassurances. In its published decision regarding the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine, Health Canada wrote that the data confirms the vaccine is roughly 95 per cent effective, and was \u201cwell tolerated\u201d with no serious safety concerns. \u201cI would say to Canadians, we\u2019ve authorized it. If it is their turn to get the vaccine, they absolutely should feel comfortable getting that,\u201d Dr. Supriya Sharma, chief medical advisor with the regulatory branch of Health Canada, told reporters when the vaccine was approved last week. She added that the reactions observed so far have been \u201cmild,\u201d including pain at the injection site, body chills, a fever or feeling sluggish. While two allergic reactions to the vaccines took place in the United Kingdom, the individuals both had histories of allergic reactions to other things \u2014 and Canada is keeping a close eye on this and any other adverse reactions. And while the pharmaceutical companies might not be responsible for any adverse reactions to these vaccines, that doesn\u2019t mean Canadians are left in the lurch in the exceedingly rare event that any vaccine \u2014 coronavirus or otherwise \u2014 causes them harm. In a Friday press release, the government announced its intention to establish a \u201cpan-Canadian no-fault vaccine injury support program\u201d that provides Canadians with support in the \u201crare event that they experience an adverse reaction to a vaccine.\u201d Anand pointed to this compensation program on Monday as she fielded questions about the indemnity that has been granted to vaccine manufacturers. \u201cThe idea that they would get Health Canada approval and therefore be deemed to be safe and effective is fundamentally important to us having this successful vaccine strategy. That\u2019s why you won\u2019t see any rollout of a vaccine until Health Canada approves it,\u201d Anand said. \u201cBy the same token, however, it is important \u2026 for Canadians to know that if there is an issue at all with the technology in these novel vaccines, that they do have access to a regime that aims to protect them.\u201d As of Tuesday, the first Pfizer coronavirus vaccine doses have already been administered in Canada. The milestone comes as cases continue to rise. There have been 460,743 cases of COVID-19 to date, including 13,431 deaths. There are also 74,059 active cases across the country."},

What that means is that when an infected person coughs or sneezes, they expel tiny water droplets containing the virus to a distance of about six feet away, he said. These droplets are heavy enough that they can\u2019t stay in the air for longer than a few minutes, so they fall onto whatever is under them: a table, for example, or your arm. When you bring these droplets to a mucous membrane, like your eye or your mouth, that\u2019s how you might catch the virus. To make the risk of spread on public transit even smaller than it already is, Bogoch recommends that users practice \u201cimpeccable hand hygiene.\u201d This means \u201cif you\u2019re going to be touching high contact surfaces \u2026 make sure to use an alcohol hand sanitizer or wash your hands afterwards, and be mindful not to touch your face right now,\u201d Bogoch said. \u201cIt\u2019s really as simple as that.\u201d It can also help to slow the spread of coronavirus and other germs to practice what Bogoch calls \u201ccough hygiene.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t cough directly into your hand and then touch things or into the air around,\u201d he said. He recommends stifling your cough with your elbow. Should you stop taking public transit? Bogoch doesn\u2019t believe this step is necessary. \u201cTo each their own. Everyone\u2019s entitled to their own opinions, but I think people need to recognize that their risk on public transportation is extremely low,\u201d he said. Some\u00a0 \u00a0transit agencies are quietly taking steps to protect customers against the\u00a0 \u00a0that\u2019s been sounding alarm bells around the world. Several say they have stepped up efforts to clean vehicles and stations and switched to more aggressive anti-microbial cleansers as a precaution. Metrolinx spokeswoman Anne Marie Aikins says long-lasting disinfectant spray was tested on one of its GO Transit trains recently, and is being rolled out to the entire network after a patient who tested positive for COVID-19 used one of its vehicles to travel home from the airport. Aikins said the product primarily targets bacteria and mould rather than viruses, but the company views it as a sensible precaution. \u201cWe think it\u2019s just incumbent on us to do whatever we can to protect our staff and our customers,\u201d she said. Aikins said the presence of an infected passenger was not unexpected and could happen again as the outbreak runs its course, but the company is prepared. Aikins said the bus on which the patient travelled has also been taken out of service for thorough decontamination. All other vehicles and terminals are being subjected to more regular cleaning, she said, adding hand sanitizer is also being made more widely available to passengers. Similar measures are being taken at the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), said spokesman Stuart Green. Railings and other regular points of contact in TTC stations are getting daily wipe downs rather than weekly, he said, adding a disinfectant wipe down has also been added to the daily bathroom-cleaning routine. Similar measures are in place on the transit provider\u2019s subways, buses and streetcars, he said, adding the company is also considering switching to a long-lasting disinfectant. Green said the TTC\u2019s action plan is based on advice from Toronto Public Health, which along with comparable agencies across the country, has described the risk of contracting the virus as very low. \u201cRight now, they\u2019ve told us that what we\u2019re doing is fine,\u201d he said, \u201cso we\u2019re comfortable that we\u2019re doing all we need to do now.\u201d Transit agencies in Montreal and Vancouver said they, too, are taking cues from public health officials, who have long maintained that individual measures such as washing hands regularly, covering coughs and sneezes and staying home if ill, offer the most effective protection from the virus. \u201cProvincial Health Services says the risk to the public and staff remains low and it has not directed us to make any operational changes at this time,\u201d said a statement from Vancouver\u2019s TransLink. \u201cWe are working closely with Provincial Health Services Authority to monitor this situation.\u201d The Societe de Transport de Montreal said it\u2019s urging passengers and staff to observe recommended hygiene protocols, but offered no other details. When it comes to whether public transit agencies should be doing more, Bogoch believes a shared responsibility. \u201cOn the one hand, we\u2019re in the midst of a global epidemic,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, we can do small things that are truly helpful, that will reduce our risk and we can continue with our day-to-day lives.\u201d In reality, public transit users need to do their part to practise good hygiene and ensure they aren\u2019t spreading anything to their peers. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, stay home. \u201cOrganizations have to do their part, for sure, but so do individuals. We\u2019re in this together.\u201d \u2014\u00a0 Meghan.Collie@globalnews.ca"},

And for the first time, it appears some of the cases came from community spread instead of via travel. Of the 17 cases, 14 are in Calgary and three are in Edmonton, Kenney said, adding he thinks the province has reached an \u201cinflection point\u201d in the pandemic. \u201cFor at least some of the new cases over the weekend, public health officials have not confirmed a travel history or close contact with a traveller. This indicates community spread,\u201d Kenney said, explaining that investigations are ongoing. Alberta Health said two people are receiving treatment in hospital and are in stable condition. The other 15 cases are self-isolating at home and expected to make a full recovery. Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the province\u2019s chief medical officer of health, said there are \u201cseveral\u201d concerning elements about the new cases. \u201cOur investigation determined that seven of these cases stem from a single gathering that took place in Calgary zone,\u201d she said. \u201cThis underlines the fact that gatherings can accelerate spread of the virus. In addition, at least two of the cases within the last two days appear to have been acquired from an unknown source. This means we are likely seeing community transmission in Alberta. \u201cCommunity transmission is when a person catches the virus from someone who stayed in the province and not from someone who recently travelled.\u201d Kenney said in response to the increase in cases, there will be an immediate cancellation of all kindergarten to Grade 12 classes and the closure of licenced child care programs in the province. The province said in-person post-secondary classes are cancelled but campuses will remain open. Classes are cancelled until further notice. There is no specific timeline, given the rapidly changing developments, Alberta Health said. The province had initially planned to keep classes running while asking students to keep their distance from one another. Schools had also been given strict guidelines for how to monitor children, what to look for and when to send them home. Hinshaw said that based on what she has seen over the last two days, it was time for additional action and it\u2019s not a decision that she made lightly. \u201cI recognize that this is extremely disruptive for many families and for those working in these sectors.\u201d She said school officials were telling her it would be impossible to follow the required steps and keep classes going, so she decided to make the change in spite of the massive impact. \u201cWe need to put in more restrictions to help slow the virus and protect public health,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why, effective immediately, the emergency management cabinet committee has approved my recommendation that students no longer attend classes in schools or post-secondary institutions until further notice.\u201d She added that some approved day homes are an exception, due to the small numbers of children present. Hinshaw clarified the government is not closing schools, saying that staff should continue to go to school to \u201cplan potential alternatives for students.\u201d Education Minister Adriana LaGrange addressed student progress at the briefing. \u201cWe expect every student to receive a final mark and that students will progress to their next grade level next year,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, provincial assessments such as provincial achievement tests will be cancelled as of this time. Grade 12 diploma exams needed to get into university will go ahead, LaGrange said, adding details were still being worked out as to how to administer those exams. \u201cDiploma exams essential for post-secondary acceptance will continue. We are confident that every student who is eligible to graduate from Grade 12 this year will graduate.\u201d Edmonton Public School Board superintendent Darrel Robertson said there are a variety of online education delivery options. \u201cWe\u2019re a district that uses Google pretty extensively, so we\u2019re examining whether Google Hangouts might be an option for teachers to communicate with their kids,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cWe also have a platform called SchoolZone, and for any parents they\u2019d be aware that teachers are able to post things like homework and so-on and so-forth in SchoolZone and they have a secure access to that. So w\u2019ere going to, in the coming days, look at a variety of opportunities.\u201d Kenney announced a   to ensure \u201cfront-line health professionals have the tools they need for testing, surveillance and treatment of patients as the province works to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\u201d He said the money is in addition to the already-budgeted $20.6 billion for Alberta Health. The premier called the coronavirus pandemic an \u201cunprecedented public health emergency for Alberta.\u201d \u201cWe are still in the early stages and the number of cases will continue to rise,\u201d Kenney said. Kenney said people returning from abroad must be vigilant and watch for virus symptoms. He said all non-essential travel plans should be cancelled. \u201cI still hear about people planning to take spring break vacations outside of the country. If they do so, they may have difficulty getting back into Canada because of the cancellation of flights. If they do come back, they will be required to self-isolate for 14 days,\u201d he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThere is no good reason to be travelling for leisure purposes at this time. I have asked Travel Alberta, in fact, to redirect all of their advertising to informing Canadians who are, for example, snowbirds in overseas locations about the protocols for their return to Alberta to help us manage the COVID-19 response.\u201d Alberta Health said long-term care facilities should be limited to essential visitors only. Hinshaw added that places of worship would be under the same restrictions as other gatherings effective immediately, meaning that events with more than 250 people present should be cancelled. \u201cI encourage religious leaders to work with their faith communities to determine how they can continue to support each other, but in ways that reduce the risk of infection spreading,\u201d she said. Hinshaw stressed the importance of taking a \u201csociety-wide\u201d approach to stop COVID-19\u2019s spread. \u201cWe\u2019re making the best decisions we can at each given time and continually evaluating to determine if those recommendations need to be further changed and made more aggressive,\u201d she said. Kenney reminded people that everyone is responsible for each other\u2019s health. \u201cSeniors and those with compromised immune systems are the ones with the highest risk,\u201d he said. \u201cSo just because you don\u2019t feel at risk yourself doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t More restrictions might be rolled out in the coming days, Kenney said. \u201cWe have full confidence in our public health and safety officials, and we\u2019re working together to do everything in our power to contain the outbreak and to keep Albertans safe and healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are equally dedicated to managing the very serious economic consequences of the pandemic and the coincident global crash in energy prices.\u201d"},

For many businesses, a   promises employers a return to some form of normal. Many will be looking to recover profits while offering a safe and healthy workplace for both staff and customers. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t But can an employer require you to get vaccinated in order to return to work? \u201cGenerally, no, an employer can\u2019t force an employee to get vaccinated,\u201d said Andrew Monkhouse, a Toronto-based employment lawyer. \u201cThe question becomes, though, can an employer terminate an employee because they don\u2019t want to take a vaccination?\u201d That\u2019s where it gets complicated, said Monkhouse. \u201cIf the reason for refusing the vaccine is not for medical or religious reasons, the employer could choose to push it as far as termination.\u201d Though a mandatory vaccination policy won\u2019t fly, employers will strongly encourage their employees to get the shot \u201cfor their safety and the safety of others,\u201d said Lior Samfiru, the founder of the labour and employment law practice at Samfiru Tumarkin LLP. Employers may even offer incentives, he said, though it\u2019s unlikely it would be a monetary one. \u201cThe incentive has to do with work conditions. It can\u2019t be looked at as a punishment to those that have not been vaccinated,\u201d he said. Incentives that differentiate employees or appear to treat those who have been vaccinated \u201cbetter\u201d than those who haven\u2019t \u201ccould be considered a human rights violation,\u201d said Samfiru. \u201cDo you want to be comfortable at work and not have to wear a mask for 10 hours? Then get vaccinated. That\u2019s the type of incentive.\u201d But some employees may refuse, Monkhouse added, and some of the reasons for refusal will be legally valid. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Anti-discrimination laws would enable eligible employees to forgo getting a   vaccine or be considered exempt from a company-wide mandate. By law, Canadian workers could request an exemption for medical, religious and philosophical reasons. The same exemptions apply at public schools in some provinces, like Ontario and New Brunswick, where children up to a certain age are required to be immunized against a number of infectious diseases to attend. An employer who fires an employee who refuses to get a COVID-19 vaccine for such a reason could have a human rights violation on their hands, according to Monkhouse. However, he said an employer can \u201ctechnically\u201d fire an employee whose reason for refusing a vaccine is simply based on choice or preference. But even then, it can get tricky, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also expensive to terminate people,\u201d said Monkhouse. \u201cThose employees would be owed a fair amount of money, of severance, which would discourage the employer from letting someone go.\u201d Unionized situations would be different, he added, since employees can only be terminated for \u201cjust cause,\u201d and the refusal to take a vaccine would \u201calmost certainly not be considered cause.\u201d But all of this could potentially be a moot point if the government decides to intervene, Samfiru said. \u201cShort of that, an employer to take it upon themselves and implement a unilateral rule \u2014 that would likely be problematic.\u201d Governments do have the power to implement rules that require vaccinations in the workplace or otherwise, but so far, it\u2019s not the route being taken. Officials at both the federal and provincial levels have repeatedly said the vaccine, once approved, will be voluntary. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has gone as far as promising to   to ensure there is no possibility the province could impose vaccinations. British Columbia\u2019s chief public health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, said voluntary vaccination even   like hospital and long-term care workers. Just yesterday Ontario Premier Doug Ford  . The World Health Organization doesn\u2019t foresee mandatory vaccinations being introduced or enforced globally either. The agency\u2019s top emergency expert, Mike Ryan, said the world is \u201cmuch better served to present people with data, present people with the benefits and let people make up their own minds, within reason.\u201d Samfiru said it\u2019s possible the tone could change in the future, but it\u2019s \u201cpreferable\u201d the government doesn\u2019t intervene at all. He said the hope is that enough people will be vaccinated on their own voluntarily. Samfiru\u2019s comments echo that of Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott, who said Monday that \u201cconstitutionally\u201d the government can\u2019t force every single person to get the vaccine, but that \u201cthere may be some restrictions\u201d that arise for those who opt out. The Ontario government announced Tuesday that it would  , as it may be required to access certain settings once the worst of the pandemic passes. It\u2019s something employers and workplaces should be thinking ahead about, experts agree. \u201cTermination, at the end of the day, is a bad idea, not only for legal reasons but certainly PR reasons,\u201d said Monkhouse. \u201cNobody wants to be the first employer who terminates someone because they refuse to take a vaccine.\u201d Employers may have other options, the experts say. \u201cA lot of companies are going to choose to say, \u2018If you don\u2019t get a vaccine, then you will continue to work from home, or we\u2019re not going to be able to call you back,\u201d said Monkhouse. \u201cLater, when the government lifts the quarantine level, the rest of the workforce could be called back.\u201d To achieve herd immunity, only about 60 to 70 per cent of the population has to be vaccinated, according to infectious disease experts. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t But if an unvaccinated employee can show that they can work safely by \u201cengaging in other measures\u201d \u2014 such as mask-wearing and physical distancing \u2014 and the employer still isn\u2019t allowing that person to work, Samfiru said a human rights claim is possible. The employer may have more flexibility if there\u2019s public backlash about employees not being completely vaccinated, he added. \u201cIf a business can show they\u2019d have no customers, that no one would frequent their establishment or service until everyone was vaccinated, they\u2019d have a lot more leeway,\u201d he said. It could very well come down to a competitive edge, added Monkhouse. \u201cIn the same way you see places advertising sanitization, plexiglass, everyone wearing masks, I certainly think we\u2019re going to see signs saying, \u2018Everyone in this store has been vaccinated,'\u201d he said. \u201cIt might be that extra push to ensure everyone\u2019s extra safe.\u201d"},

An appointment to discuss surgery on her legs was cancelled, and her sleep and care schedule are in flux because her personal support workers keep changing. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in jail.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Her exercise program with March of Dimes Canada, a rehabilitation foundation for disabled persons, was cancelled, and Blake said she\u2019s been less physically active than usual. \u201cIt\u2019s been really making me tight, really making me feel like I\u2019m fighting with my body,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t just get up and walk.

I miss interacting with people. Because when you look at a computer, it\u2019s great but it\u2019s not the same as seeing them face-to-face.\u201d One in four Canadians \u2014 about 25 per cent of the population \u2014 has a disability,  . \u00a0Despite this, advocates say they are often left out of emergency planning. David Lepofsky, who chairs the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act Alliance, likened the situation to a fire raging inside of an apartment building complex, where the people inside are alerted by a fire alarm and loudspeaker that tells them to exit by taking designated stairs illuminated by clearly-indicated markers. A person who is deaf wouldn\u2019t hear the fire alarm. A person in a wheelchair would be trapped inside. And those designated markers will do nothing for someone who can\u2019t see. Unless they receive support, Lepofsky said anyone with disabilities living in the building will likely not survive. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Similarly, he said the government has applied a mostly one-size-fits-all approach to   measures that offer little support the country\u2019s disabled. \u201cIt\u2019s because of their disability and it\u2019s because no one planned for them in the emergency,\u201d he said. Often, Canadians with more severe disabilities will get placed in long-term care facilities, where  . Lepofsky said that poses a danger to those with disabilities, as well. He said comparable problems arise in Ontario\u2019s virtual elementary and secondary education system, called   The program isn\u2019t user-friendly for students with disabilities who may be deaf, blind or unable to use a mouse, said Lepofsky. Despite making up upwards of one-in-six of the student population, he said much of the program was made with only able-bodied students in mind. When asked about this, the Ontario Ministry of Education said in a statement to Global News that Education Minister Stephen Lecce had convened two \u201curgent\u201d discussions with the Minister\u2019s Advisory Council on Special Education where they discussed how best to support students and families during this period and has consulted the K-12 Standards Development Committee struck by the Ministry for Seniors and Accessibility. They said all resources were reviewed for accessibility based on the standards of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (2005), but that school boards were ultimately responsible for making decisions on the use of digital learning resources and collaboration tools to support students\u2019 learning online. \u201cThe Ministry has provided clear direction to school boards on how to support students with special education and mental health needs during school closures,\u201d they said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t March of Dimes Canada president Len Baker said even before the existence of COVID-19, people with disabilities were facing \u201csignificant\u201d challenges every day, including already-existing barriers like attitudinal ones about disability. \u201cThose historic barriers become exacerbated during a time such as this pandemic, where now not only do they have to address the issues that they need\u00a0to be able to complete their goals and feel connected to the community, but with social distancing and the isolation that the pandemic brings, it causes us concern that many individuals are going to feel even a greater sense of isolation and loneliness during this time,\u201d he said. Baker said around 50,000 students with disabilities rely on the organization for opportunities to read, learn skills, get out in the community, to participate and connect with others. But since the pandemic started, he said they\u2019ve had to revamp their services to be available virtually or over the phone. Marielle Hossack, press secretary to the minister of employment, workforce development and disability inclusion, said in a statement to Global News the federal government has increased human resources for support services for Canadians with disabilities over the phone and online, and is looking into implementing ALS and LSQ into current and future emergency responses. The federal government has also established the COVID-19 Disability Advisory Group, which is comprised of experts in disability inclusion, that provide advice on \u201creal-time live experiences of persons with disabilities.\u201d Hossack wrote the group discusses disability-specific issues, challenges and systemic gaps as well as strategies, measures and steps to be taken. But some advocates don\u2019t think that\u2019s enough. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Karine Myrgianie Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, director of operations at DisAbled Women\u2019s Network Canada, told Global News that despite making up such a large percentage of the population, many are not getting support services typically provided by provincial health departments or social services. This is due to a lot of factors, she said \u2014 because there\u2019s a lack of protective equipment, because people are getting sick, because it\u2019s too dangerous. For children with disabilities, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois said the pandemic means they\u2019re often relying on their parents for mental and physical support they would have received at school. \u201cA lot of the measures that have been made to prepare for this pandemic have been done to think about the greatest number of people, which often means that we forget about people who are more marginalized and people who have a disability are included in that,\u201d she said. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois said that includes the  . , 70 per cent of Canadians eligible for the disability tax credit will receive the enhanced GST/HST benefit based on their income levels due to COVID-19, but that may not add up to much for Canadians with disabilities who may also need to hire food deliveries, in-house care, or those that would be deemed ineligible for the aid because they\u2019re unable to work. The money \u201cdoesn\u2019t go as far as it used to,\u201d she said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t When factored to include the rising cost of living, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois said most Canadians with disabilities \u2014 many of whom are already living at or near the poverty line \u2014 end up barely scraping by. \u201cWe\u2019re not all equal under COVID-19,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to be looking at\u2026 who stands up to make sure that people get what they need, and how to make sure that they\u2019re supported in what they\u2019re doing both financially but also mentally, because it\u2019s it\u2019s really hard work to support people who were left alone.\u201d"},

That is an increase of just two hospitalizations from Wednesday, but Henry said she didn\u2019t \u201cdare hope\u201d that infections were leveling off. She redoubled her call for people to stay home and keep two metres away from others in public to stop the spread of the virus.

Officials have said they expect doses of the Moderna vaccine to arrive in Canada within 48 hours of approval. The government has inked a deal to get 168,000 doses of the vaccine by the end of December. \u201cNow that Health Canada has approved the Moderna vaccine, we have the green light to start rolling it out across the country \u2026 the first doses of our 40 million dose order from Moderna will arrive in the coming days,\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Speaking at a media conference Wednesday, Dr. Supriya Sharma, chief medical advisor with the regulatory branch of Health Canada,\u00a0 said the authorization is a \u201ccritical step\u201d in ensuring a COVID-19 vaccine is available to all Canadians. \u201cHealth Canada authorized the vaccine after an independent and thorough scientific review for safety, efficacy and quality. After accessing all the data we concluded there was strong evidence that showed the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks,\u201d she said. A second wave of the novel coronavirus is sweeping Canada and medical officials in some parts of the country say the health care system is under dangerous strain. Canada has recorded a total of 14,425 deaths and 521,509 cases. The news of Moderna\u2019s approval comes after the first doses of Pfizer\u2019s   vaccine were administered to Canadians last week. Moderna said its vaccine is nearly 94.1 per cent effective in protecting people from the  , and requires two doses, 28 days apart. \u201cAlthough the immunity builds over a period of time, and there are measurements of immunity before that second dose\u2026 in the case of Moderna, they are quite high they are at a level of about 80 per cent,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cBut really the question is how long that immunity lasts\u2026 so we would recommend that a second dose is given.\u201d She added that the second dose has \u201cvariability\u201d to when you can give the second dose. Health Canada said the vaccine does not have any safety concerns but said not to get the shot if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients in the vaccine. The agency also warned against getting the shot if you have symptoms of COVID-19. The agency said side effects are \u201cmild\u201d and include tiredness, headache, muscle aches, chills, fever, nausea and swelling or redness at the injection site. Anyone who is pregnant, planning to get pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed can still get the shot but needs to consult with their doctor first. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The vaccine is not yet recommended for use on children as tests on adolescents only began in December and tests on children younger than 12 won\u2019t begin until next year. Health Canada said if you have previously had COVID-19 you can still get vaccinated. Canada\u2019s doses of the Moderna vaccine are being made in Europe. Unlike Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine, which has strict cold-chain requirements, Moderna\u2019s shot can survive in regular freezers, meaning it\u2019s prioritized for delivery to the territories, remote Indigenous communities and long-term care sites. The Health Canada statement called Wednesday\u2019s decision a \u201ccritical step\u201d to getting vaccines to all parts of the country. \u201cThe different storage and handling requirements of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine mean that it can be distributed to isolated and remote communities, including the territories,\u201d the statement said. Canada signed a deal in September for 20 million doses to be delivered at the beginning of 2021, with the option of increasing the supply to 56 million doses. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Health Canada is still reviewing two more vaccines, with AstraZeneca\u2019s potentially needing more study before the regulator is ready to make a decision and the Johnson & Johnson review still in the very early stages. Health Canada approved the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech Dec. 9, and the first doses began arriving in Canada on Dec. 13. The United States approved the vaccine last Friday."},

This once-in-a-generation crisis has not been met with a unified response, or a common will to fight. Instead, the nation keeps going around in circles, dooming itself to the grim promise of more dark days ahead. \u201cWe will be at 300,000 deaths by Dec. 1,\u201d warns Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College, \u201cand maybe even 400,000 deaths by the time of the next presidential inauguration.\u201d A projection from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington   as early as Jan. 1, 2021. Of the approximately 31 million cases and nearly one million COVID-19 deaths worldwide, the United States has suffered at a disproportionately high rate. On the same day the U.S. reached 200,000 deaths, it edged closer to its seven millionth case. \u201cWe need a national response,\u201d says Dr. Ali Mokdad, who developed the IHME model. \u201cIf we do so, like other countries, we can control this virus.\u201d There seems to be little chance of that happening in the current climate. The use of facemasks is still an open debate, fueled by a president who has oscillated between mocking masks, wearing one himself, and mocking them again. During an ABC News town hall this week,  , who is not currently president, for failing to implement a national mask mandate. Trump has also returned to holding indoor campaign rallies without masks or physical distancing, despite his admission to Bob Woodward in February that he understood the virus  . Typically, the only person socially distanced at these events is Trump, who is consistently kept at a good distance from everyone else. At the same time, President Trump is still promising a magical end to the pandemic; proclaiming the virus \u201cwill just disappear;\u201d promoting unproven cures like hydroxychloroquine or convalescent plasma; and promising a vaccine will be ready this fall, without acknowledging it could take another year or more to immunize the public on a wide scale. All the while, state and local decision-makers \u2014 and everyday Americans \u2014 go through the same circular arguments themselves. In one America, the virus is treated as a serious threat, reopening is cautious and phased, masks are widely used and virus cases are low. In the other America, there\u2019s a rush to act as though everything is normal, with precautions ignored, and masks shunned, even as case numbers surge. \u201cHow can we pretend like everything\u2019s normal?\u201d asks Dayna James, an emergency room nurse in Miami. \u201cHave one 12-hour shift alongside me, and maybe you\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d James says the situation at her hospital in Florida has improved since the peak of cases in early August, but she\u2019s worried that people will assume the worst is over. \u201cI\u2019m really expecting a second wave,\u201d she says. \u201cDecisions were made on some level to open up everything, and I don\u2019t think that we have a good enough handle on it.\u201d In the absence of a strategy, the pandemic has adopted a rhythm of its own. Case numbers spike, then drop, only to spike to a higher level, and never drop down as low as they were before. It\u2019s not so much a wave, as a continuously rising tide, where the number of daily infections remains \u201cunacceptably high,\u201d according to experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci. That has jeopardized the viability of reopening schools and colleges, and made it all but impossible that businesses like restaurants will be able to resume normal operations for the long term. Every aspect of daily life is now subject to the whims of something that can\u2019t be seen \u2014 what Trump has called \u201cthe invisible enemy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s beyond frustrating knowing that the sort of simple pleasures in life have evaporated,\u201d Dr. Hotez says. \u201cThe quality of life in the United States is not very good right now.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Still, almost everything to do with the pandemic is viewed through a political lens \u2014 though the virus does not care whether its hosts are Democrats or Republicans. Dr. Hotez blames a lack of federal strategy for both a failure to respond and the political weaponization of the pandemic, accusing the president of running a \u201cdisinformation campaign.\u201d As a result, Hotez says, \u201cthe American public never really fully understood or appreciated the gravity of the COVID-19 pandemic, until they started seeing family members and friends get sick or hospitalized.\u201d Americans who haven\u2019t seen that first-hand, have the privilege of ignoring the virus altogether or decrying it as a hoax. Those who face the real consequences have been disproportionately Black or Hispanic, had lower incomes, and at risk of greatest exposure through front-line work. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t All these months later, few experts are optimistic that will happen. There are no domestic travel restrictions within the United States, and state-level quarantine requirements are not enforced with the kind of rigor that countries like Canada and Australia have adopted. The crude, and often used analogy, is that the U.S. has tried to build a no-peeing section in a swimming pool \u2014 there\u2019s nothing to stop the virus from spreading from high-risk areas to low-risk ones. An analysis of a large-scale motorcycle rally in Sturgis,   estimated that the event led to 260,000 COVID-19 cases, and $12.2 billion in public health costs nationwide, after nearly half a million people gathered for the event and then disbursed around the country. The way out requires Americans everywhere to be on the same page about how to respond. \u201cYou want to open schools, you want to open up colleges, you want to have sporting events?\u201d asks Dr. Hotez. \u201cWe can do all those things, but we\u2019ve got to bring the entire nation down to some agreed-upon low level of containment.\u201d In a recent interview with Global News, Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, expressed his fear that Americans will simply give up, and stop taking precautions out of sheer frustration. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that people are going to get so discouraged, they\u2019re going to loosen up the kinds of attention to public health measures which we need to continue to focus on if we\u2019re going to keep this under control,\u201d Fauci said. Continue to be careful,\u201d Fauci pleaded. \u201cIt will end. We will get back to normal.\u201d Hotez cautioned it will be a slow road back. \u201cSorry to be so sombre,\u201d he said, adding there are no quick fixes. \u201cI think a year from now, life will be better than it is now. And I think a year after that, it will be even better, but it may not be completely normal by then.\u201d"},
{"title": "Travellers must take a COVID-19 test before flying to Canada. Here\u2019s what you need to know - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted December 31, 2020 9:17 pm", "body": "In one week, Canada will require anyone entering the country to have a negative   test before boarding their flight. The new rules, which were first announced Wednesday, are meant to further limit the spread of the novel   pandemic in Canada, which is continuing to see a surge of infections, hospitalizations and deaths through the winter. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t On Thursday, the federal government detailed exactly how the new requirements will work \u2014 including what will happen if a test can\u2019t be acquired before travel. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the rules, which take effect on Jan. 7. Flyers aged five and up will need to take a COVID-19 molecular polymerase chain reaction (or PCR) test within 72 hours before their flight\u2019s scheduled departure. That test result must come back negative, and written or electronic proof of the negative result must be shown to the airline prior to boarding the flight to Canada. \u201cThis timing recognizes that it may take a few days for passengers to receive their results following a PCR test,\u201d the government said in a statement. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The test must be provided by a lab accredited by \u201can external organization\u201d like a local government or professional lab in the country where the traveller is flying out of. If proof of a negative PCR test is not provided to the airline at the time of boarding, travellers will be denied entry to the flight unless exempt. Anyone travelling from a country where PCR testing is not available will be required to report to a designated federal quarantine facility maintained by the Public Health Agency of Canada. Travellers will have to stay in that site for the entire 14-day self-quarantine period mandated by existing travel measures. Anyone planning to travel outside of Canada once the new rules are in place are being urged to check if the country they\u2019re travelling to has PCR testing available before booking a trip. Travellers can cover the cost of a PCR test through their travel insurance provider, so long as they include COVID-19-related medical expenses in their coverage. The government is recommending all travellers get travel insurance immediately and make sure their plan covers medical expenses related to the pandemic, including testing and cancellations or rebookings in case of testing delays. Otherwise, travellers will be responsible for paying for testing themselves. Consular services will also not cover expenses in case travellers cannot return to Canada due to a missing or delayed test. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The government is also advising that the Emergency Loan Program will not apply to most Canadians currently abroad to cover the cost of testing or flight cancellations, as those travellers \u201chad plenty of time and opportunity to return to Canada since the pandemic reached a critical point\u201d this past spring. The loan program can not be used to cover costs related to isolation or self-quarantine after arriving back in Canada either, the government says. Currently, proof that a traveller has been vaccinated against the coronavirus cannot replace proof of a negative test before boarding a flight to Canada. \u201cWhile a vaccine protects an individual from illness, further evidence is required to understand if a vaccinated person can still (spread the) virus,\u201d the government said. Besides children under five years of age, travellers exempt from providing proof of a negative test include emergency service providers, airline crew members and people travelling on refueling flights. Current health measures like temperature checks and mandatory masks on flights must still be followed despite proof of a negative test. Once back in Canada, travellers will still need to provide a detailed 14-day self-quarantine plan to Canada Border Service Agency officers stationed at airports across the country. Travellers must also enter their quarantine plans into the   and provide updates as needed. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Anyone whose quarantine plans are ruled to be insufficient will be mandated to quarantine in a Public Health Agency of Canada facility. The government is still advising all Canadians to avoid any non-essential travel amid the pandemic, which has infected roughly 580,000 people and killed more than 15,600 across the country as of Dec. 31. Canada\u2019s chief public health officer, Theresa Tam, said Thursday she is deeply concerned Canadians are still traveling for non-essential reasons, ignoring advice not to do so. \u201cI am asking Canadians to reassess any travel plans,\u201d she said."},

So no one should have to travel too far. The pace of the vaccine deliveries to Saskatchewan will be picking up significantly in the coming weeks but we still expect demand to exceed supply,\u201d Health Minister Paul Merriman said on Wednesday. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cIf you\u2019re not eligible, please don\u2019t test the system. We\u2019ve seen that in other provinces, British Columbia had 100,000 people eligible and they had 1.7 million people try to access and it crashed the system. We need to be able to make sure that our seniors have the first opportunity to be able to book in their appointments so they can get vaccinated first. That\u2019s our priority. \u201cThat\u2019s why we picked from 85 and over to start so we had a very select amount of people \u2026 Right now, there\u2019s going to be a low number there so that gives us an opportunity to test the system, to see how the uptake is and that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t open it too wide.\u201d As of 4 p.m. Thursday, SHA said 4,351 appointments have been scheduled. 3,063 appointments were made online and 1,288 were made by phone. Phone appointments can be made by calling 1-833-727-5829.

Identification is also required upon arrival for appointments, to ensure vaccination of the same person who was registered online.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The SHA said it will announce further age groups that will become eligible to book their appointments in the coming days, based on an available supply of vaccine. During a press briefing on Wednesday, SHA CEO Scott Livingston said they\u2019ll start administering the second doses as soon as possible. \u201cWe expect to see that (vaccine) supply flow in the same manner and volume,\u201d he said. \u201cSo depending upon uptake but certainly having everybody with two shots in their arm is certainly doable, we believe, by fall of this year but certainly \u2026 first vaccinations will be done sometime, hopefully, mid-June.\u201d Once the new online booking system is in place, SHA said it will phase-out the existing process of direct phone calls to eligible patients."},

Contracts totalling $2 million have been awarded to G4S Secure Solutions (Canada) Ltd., GardaWorld and Paladin Risk Solutions, according to PHAC. The Canadian Corps of Commissionaires, a non-profit that hires Canadian Armed Forces veterans and retired RCMP officers, has also been tapped to help with in-person visits. \u201cThe trained and designated Screening Officers working under these contracts will begin in-person compliance visits on January 29, 2021 beginning in Montreal and Toronto,\u201d PHAC spokesperson Tammy Jarbeau said in an email. \u201cRoll-out across Canada to 35 municipalities is anticipated in the weeks following.\u201d Trudeau\u2019s comments come after weeks of the government urging Canadians not to take any non-essential trips outside of the country, and amid a warning from Trudeau that he may impose restrictions at any time that could make it harder for them to return. The new measures are aimed at discouraging travellers from taking non-essential trips outside of the country, amid numerous reports that some Canadians have been escaping the chilly winter with vacations to sunny destinations. Cases linked to international travel account for just two per cent of COVID-19 cases in Canada. The measures come amid an uncomfortable reality about the number of travellers that are skipping quarantine measures altogether. More than 6.3 million travellers who have entered Canada since the start of the pandemic were not required to quarantine, according to   obtained Thursday from the Canada Border Services Agency. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The figure, which includes truck drivers and other essential workers who transport goods between countries, accounts for 74 per cent of the total 8.6 million travellers who entered Canada by land and air since quarantine measures were implemented in late March. In addition to the cancelled flights to sunny destinations and a new hotel bill that non-essential travellers will be forced to pay as they await mandatory test results, Trudeau announced that non-essential travellers will have to show a negative test at land borders too. \u201cWe will also, in the coming weeks, be requiring non-essential travellers to show a negative test before entry at the land border with the U.S., and we are working to stand up additional testing requirements for land travel,\u201d he said. Non-essential travel into Canada by most foreign nationals has been banned since the pandemic first began sweeping across the country last March. Anyone entering the country has been required to self-quarantine for two weeks. The federal government began beefing up those measures earlier this month. As of Jan. 7, the government has required proof of a negative COVID-19 test, taken within 72 hours of departure time, before anyone is allowed to board a flight to Canada. Quebec Premier Francois Legault and Ontario Premier Doug Ford have urged Ottawa to impose mandatory testing upon arrival in Canada as well. And they\u2019ve proposed a ban on flights from countries where the new, more contagious variants of the virus are circulating. Canada did temporarily ban flights from the United Kingdom after that country reported in December a new variant of COVID-19 that was spreading like wildfire. But the ban was lifted once the pre-departure test requirement came into effect."},

Masks are mandatory in indoor public places and are required in outdoor public spaces when physical distancing of two metres cannot be maintained. Individuals must stay within their single household bubble, which includes the people they live with, although it can include a family member who needs support from someone within a household, a caregiver or one other person who needs support. In addition, a single-family household bubble can be extended to include care for children from another household bubble for the purposes of informal daycare or online education. It must be the same household bubble for the entirety of the lockdown. In the lockdown phase, schools, colleges, universities and private schools must be closed to students. However, those facilities may admit employees for online or remote delivery of classes. No informal indoor gatherings are permitted, except within the single household. The province expects individuals to remain at home except for necessary reasons such as health services, care, childcare, child custody arrangements and work or post-secondary education. Regulated health professionals are allowed to keep their businesses open as long as they have an operational plan outlining enhanced measures. Non-regulated health-care workers are to keep their businesses closed. Restaurants are limited to drive-thru, takeout and delivery services. All gyms, fitness centres and swimming pools, public entertainment venues and farmers markets are to remain closed. Faith-based venues are to remain closed or operate only virtually. Faith-based organizations are permitted to have four or fewer people plus the celebrant working together on the production of virtual services. The goal in the red level of the COVID-19 response plan is to flatten the curve of the number of cases in the province to contain the virus as quickly as possible. Masks are mandatory in indoor public places and are required in outdoor public spaces when physical distancing of two metres cannot be maintained. The province says that essential travel is only recommended in and out of red level zones. However, people can continue to travel within the province for work, school, essential errands and medical appointments. Strict physical distancing of two metres is expected during the red phase with frequent hand washing and surface cleaning being necessary. Non-urgent medical procedures and elective surgeries could be postponed, health officials have said. Students will continue to attend school in-person with enhanced health and safety measures, including: Under the orange phase, New Brunswickers are restricted to a single household bubble which can be extended to include caregivers, a family member that needs support, one other person who needs support. Outdoor gatherings are restricted to five people or less with physical distancing. Physical distancing is required in all other settings. Religious services are restricted to drive-in services only. Non-urgent medical procedures and elective surgeries are postponed while visitor restrictions in health facilities would be in place during the red phase. A significant change from previous versions is that unregulated health professionals are now being permitted to operate during the red phase. However, they are only allowed to do so under a COVID-19 operational plan approved by the province. They must also actively screen patrons, have enhanced barriers and closed waiting rooms. Barbers, hair stylists, spas, gyms and fitness facilities are closed in this stage. Daycares will remain open while K to 12 schools are limited to virtual education only in the province\u2019s red stage. All food and beverage services will be reduced to drive-thru, take-out and delivery. Public Transit rules have also been updated to allow for operations to continue as long as physical distancing of 2 metres is followed and masks are used continuously. The orange phase in New Brunswick\u2019s plan attempts to balance the reopening of businesses with the prevention of a resurgence in COVID-19 transmission. However, the province notes that the orange phase also indicates a \u201csignificant risk that COVID-19 is no longer under control in the province.\u201d Wearing face masks is mandatory in indoor public spaces during the orange phase. Masks are to be worn in outdoor public spaces when physical distancing of two metres cannot be maintained. Individuals are restricted to a single household bubble which as of Friday, Jan. 29, can now be extended to a set of 10 consistent contacts. As an example, even though groups are allowed out into restaurants, they may not sit with people from another household bubble. Outdoor gatherings are limited to 50 people or less with physical distancing. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The province says that essential travel is only recommended in and out of orange zones. However, people can continue to travel within the province for work, school, essential errands and medical appointments. Non-urgent medical procedures are permitted during this phase. Business and other retail services are allowed to open with a COVID-19 operational plan. Faith venues can operate under an approved COVID-19 operation plan but the province says that in-person services are limited to 50 participants or fewer depending on the size of the facility. Unregulated health professionals, barbers, hair stylists and spas may operate under a COVID-19 operational plan. They must actively screen patrons, have enhanced barriers and closed waiting rooms. Gyms and fitness facilities may also operate under a COVID-19 operation plan although physical distancing of two metres and masks are mandatory for \u201clow-intensity fitness classes\u201d such as yoga, tai chi and stretching. For high-intensity activities such as spin, aerobics and boot camps, that physical distancing must be extended to three metres. Entertainment venues such as casinos, bingo halls, arcades and cinemas may operate under a COVID-19 operations plan although occupancy limits are set at 50 patrons or fewer, depending on the size of the venue. Public Transit rules have also been updated to allow for operations to continue as long as physical distancing of one metre is followed and masks are used continuously. Record keeping of patrons is necessary for all seated venues in this phase. The goal of the yellow phase is to re-open more businesses and activities after the ability to control COVID-19 transmission has been successfully demonstrated. Face masks are still mandatory in public spaces and unofficial indoor gatherings. In this phase, informal indoor gatherings of up to 20 people are permitted and close contacts should be limited to a consistent list of family and friends. Uncontrolled outdoor gatherings are limited to 50 people or fewer as long as physical distancing is in place. Officials say that in this phase, physical distancing restrictions would be loosened to allow for households to see close friends and family. Occupancy limited in controlled indoor and outdoor settings should remain at a level that allows for physical distancing, the province\u2019s guide says, although it does not provide specific figures. However, participants must be recorded in order to facilitate contact tracing. Spots can continue to play as long as they follow their operational plan. Faith venues will continue to be open in the yellow phase as long as a physical distancing of at least one metre is maintained and everyone is wearing a mask. In order for singing to be permitted at a faith venue as long as masks must be worn and two metres of distance must be in place. New Brunswick\u2019s public transit services can operate at full ridership with the continuous use of a mask. New Brunswick officials say that the green phase will only be implemented after a vaccine for COVID-19 is created and made widely available in the province. The development of a vaccine for the disease could take between 12 and 18 months. In this phase, which remains a proposal at this time, all conditions would be lifted except for the need for face masks which would remain a requirement in public when ill."},

On Wednesday afternoon, Premier Jason Kenney announced that on the advice of Dr. Deena Hinshaw, the province\u2019s chief medical officer of health, Calgary and Brooks will see their relaunch phased in at a slower pace than the rest of Alberta. Kenney cited the fact that 75 per cent of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the province are in those two cities. \u201cI know that many folks in Calgary and Brooks will be disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t take this decision lightly. \u201cWe are prudently giving our public health experts more time to monitor trends in those communities.\u201d Kenney added that he wishes his government \u201ccould have given people weeks of notice\u201d for the exact dates of Stage 1 of the relaunch plan but that it wasn\u2019t possible. He added that since his government first unveiled its relaunch plans, it \u201cmade it very clear\u201d that no relaunch dates were set in stone. \u201c[But] I very much regret if any business has gone to expense,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cRecovered cases now outnumber active cases by about four times,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of these numbers add up to a very successful stand against COVID-19 so far in Alberta.\u201d Kenney said that while case numbers have been more concerning in Calgary and Brooks, he believes \u201cthe risk is low for Albertans wherever they live.\u201d He added that he is aware that some Albertans want a much more rapid reopening while others would like to see a far lengthier lockdown, but he believes the decision to move forward with the relaunch \u201ccomes down to relying, at the end of the day, on common sense.\u201d Kenney said he wants to remind Albertans to be diligent about helping the province avoid a so-called second wave of infections and that it is imperative people continue to follow public health orders and recommendations. He also thanked Albertans for their role in helping to curb the spread of the coronavirus, a message echoed by Hinshaw. \u201cThere have been sacrifices\u2026 I know how difficult it has been,\u201d she said. \u201cAlbertans have responded to this unprecedented challenge with compassion and grace.\u201d Hinshaw added that she feels \u201cconfident it is the right time to move into Stage 1.\u201d She also acknowledged the disappointment she imagines many Calgarians and residents of Brooks must feel. Phase 1 of the relaunch plan will allow retail businesses, such as clothing, furniture and bookstores, to reopen gradually. Cafes and restaurants with no bar service will also be allowed to run at half capacity, while hair salons, barber shops and daycares are also included in Phase 1 for all locations in Alberta, apart from Calgary and Brooks. Phase 1 will be rolled out more gradually in Brooks and Calgary: on May 14, May 25 and June 1. For more information on what can open when in Calgary and Brooks, and in other parts of Alberta,  . Hinshaw said that people in Calgary and Brooks should wait for services and businesses that will now see a delayed reopening rather than visiting other jurisdictions where those services can reopen. \u201cIt will take all our efforts [to keep cases from surging],\u201d she said. \u201cWe continue to recommend against non-essential travel,\u201d Kenney noted. Also acknowledging the frustration that some in Calgary and Brooks may feel as a result of Wednesday\u2019s relaunch announcement, Kenney said \u201cthe worst thing we could do would be to move suddenly on all those fronts at the same time,\u201d see a new surge in cases, and then need to return to restrictions that were in place before Stage 1 of the relaunch strategy. The premier added that he too is eager to see the economy get moving again and for life to return at least somewhat to normal, but that he knows there are consequences for not proceeding cautiously. Hinshaw said the government\u2019s decision to move forward with a regional relaunch approach on Thursday has her full support. P. J. L\u2019Heureux, a Calgary restaurant and club owner who also founded Craft Beer Market, said Wednesday\u2019s announcement that Alberta\u2019s largest city will see a slower relaunch was \u201cjust another blow.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s literally just as bad as closing, if not worse, because when we closed originally, we knew it was coming,\u201d he told Global News. \u201cThis one was no signs or notice at all.\u201d NDP Opposition Leader Rachel Notley issued a statement about the first phase of the relaunch and how it will be implemented more slowly in Calgary and Brooks. \u201cI feel for the Calgarians who were given a reopening date prematurely by Jason Kenney,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThere are going to a lot of business owners who were expecting to reopen. There are a lot of restaurants that stocked up on food and may now have to watch it spoil. \u201cOur NDP caucus supports reopening our economy but we have to be smarter. We shouldn\u2019t be working backwards from an arbitrary date and pressuring businesses to figure it out on their own, incurring additional costs in the process.\u201d \u201cWe need a successful relaunch that makes everyone feel confident and safe, not a scrambled relaunch where no one knows whether they are open or closed.\u201d \u201cThere have been, a couple of weeks ago, a higher number of active cases in that community, but most of those cases have now been resolved,\u201d she said. Before Kenney\u2019s news conference on Wednesday, the Alberta Federation of Labour said leaders of unions affiliated with its organization voted to send a letter to the premier urging him to delay the phased reopening of the province\u2019s economy \u201cby at least one month.\u201d The AFL said more action needs to be taken to \u201cguarantee the safety of workers and patrons in Alberta workplaces.\u201d \u201cSo far, Alberta\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been a story of success in the community, but a failure in a growing number of workplaces,\u201d AFL president Gil McGowan said in a news release. \u201cThe government\u2019s failure to be more proscriptive with employers and more aggressive with enforcement has led to unnecessary outbreaks and, sadly, a number of preventable deaths. \u201cUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem that the government has learned from these mistakes. Their guidance for employers on the subject of reopening the economy is weak, vague and often unclear.\u201d An emergency committee with the provincial cabinet met Tuesday night to officially decide whether reopening could take place as proposed Thursday. On Tuesday afternoon, Hinshaw said officials were looking at a few key elements when considering Phase 1 of the relaunch strategy. One piece to consider was whether there are any serious or concerning outbreaks. The hospitalization rate in Alberta also needs to be stable and intensive care units need to have more than 50 per cent of their beds empty for relaunch plans to move forward, Hinshaw explained. \u201cWe need to make sure we have the most up-to-date information,\u201d Hinshaw said on Tuesday. \u201cOnce we reopen, we want to stay open.\u201d On Monday, the province released further industry-specific guidelines for businesses hoping to reopen in the coming days and weeks. Provincial officials have stressed that the May 14 timeline for businesses to reopen is not mandatory; businesses owners can choose to stay closed and reopen at a later date. On Wednesday, the Alberta government said it has released  \u00a0 that provides building operators and managers with information about how to flush stagnant water out of pipes and water systems in buildings that have sat vacant or underutilized during the pandemic. \u201cBuilding operators should do this work while they continue to be partially closed and as they prepare to reopen their doors to employees, businesses and the public,\u201d the government said in a news release. On Thursday, the Alberta Parks   will open for bookings at select campgrounds starting June 1, with some restrictions in place. Kenney said his government and public health officials will closely evaluate the pandemic situation in the province ahead of each phase of its relaunch and continue to monitor for COVID-19 \u201chot spots\u201d and outbreaks. The premier added that details on his public mask distribution program would be coming soon and that he expects to roll out the program at the end of the month. He said because of global supply issues regarding masks, there would be \u201ca limited number of masks for people for the foreseeable future\u2026 that can help them if they\u2019re going out on their weekly grocery shopping visit.\u201d As of Wednesday afternoon, Hinshaw said there are 1,211 active confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Alberta and that 5,076 cases have now seen people recover. Over the past 24 hours, Hinshaw said 4,072 novel coronavirus tests have been conducted, and 62 people have tested positive in the province. Of the confirmed cases, the Calgary zone has 990 active cases and 3,301 recoveries, the South zone has 117 active cases and 1,045 recoveries, the Edmonton zone has 61 active cases and 439 recoveries, the North zone has 21 active cases and 191 recoveries, the Central zone has 14 active cases and 82 recoveries and there are eight active cases and 18 recoveries where the zone has yet to be determined. On Wednesday afternoon, Hinshaw also confirmed her team had identified a new outbreak at Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.\u2019s Horizon work camp in northern Alberta. She said five cases had been confirmed there but she is \u201cconfident the spread can be contained on this site as all measures are being taken to do this.\u201d Kenney also praised Alberta oil companies for their preparedness and handling of the COVID-19 pandemic since it arrived in the province two months ago. In terms of other outbreaks, Alberta Health said Wednesday that there are still 23 active COVID-19 cases among workers at the Cargill meat plant in High River and that 924 workers there have now recovered from the illness. At the JBS Foods meat plant in Brooks, there are currently 15 active cases among workers and 620 have now recovered. At the Harmony Beef plant near Calgary, there are now 10 active cases among workers and 30 workers have recovered from the illness. Alberta Health added there are currently 104 active cases and 562 recovered cases at continuing care facilities across the province. Eighty-six residents of those facilities have died. As of Wednesday afternoon, Alberta had 120 fatalities attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Alberta Health said two of those deaths were confirmed over the past 24 hours. Eighty-four of those deaths have been in the Calgary zone, 15 in the North zone, 12 in the Edmonton zone, eiht in the South zone and one in the Central zone. As of Wednesday evening, Alberta had tested 181,624 people for the novel coronavirus and 165,888 people had signed up for the province\u2019s voluntary contact-tracing app ABTraceTogether."},

However, she urged British Columbians to keep their Thanksgiving celebrations small this weekend and find ways to connect that don\u2019t put people at risk. Henry also used her briefing Thursday to urge businesses to review their COVID-19 safety plans, with respiratory illness season fast approaching. Businesses should make it easy for workers who feel ill to stay home, and integrate health screening as a regular part of everyone\u2019s workday.

And are these restrictions really necessary?,\u2019\u201d Russell said. \u201cYes it is that bad, and these restrictions are required.\u201d Russell said the province can get to a place where it sees an exponential number of new cases each day. \u201cThings can get worse, and they will get worse without decisive action,\u201d she said. \u201cStay in your zone and don\u2019t travel unnecessarily. Plan your week so you don\u2019t have to make multiple trips to the grocery store.\u201d Premier Blaine Higgs said in the briefing that the province will not hesitate to announce even stricter measures if necessary. \u201cI continue to be disappointed,\u201d Higgs said. \u201cThis is indeed a very serious situation.\u201d He said if the situation doesn\u2019t improve, \u201ca full lockdown like we saw in March of last year,\u201d may be coming. Public Health is determining what a lockdown would look like at this point. \u201cWe have never been a situation like this since the pandemic began. We have never had so many cases,\u201d he said. Higgs pleaded New Brunswickers once again to follow the rules as the majority of residents is now under the red alert level. Public Health doesn\u2019t know if new variants of COVID-19 are present in New Brunswick at this time. \u201cMoving additional zones to the red level will impact many businesses,\u201d Higgs said, adding that grants of up to $5,000 are still available to small businesses in the orange or red phase. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Higgs reminded residents that the province has decided to keep schools open under the red level, although its initial recovery plan was moving to online learning. He said staff will be checked for symptoms every day before reporting to work. Should a case in a school appear, the school will close for minimum three days, and the school will become a testing site for staff. A number of schools across the province reported cases of COVID-19 in the last two weeks. Last week, those schools included: Kennebecasis Valley High School in Quispamsis; Belleisle Elementary School in Springfield; Millidgeville North School in Saint John; and Riverview East School and Caledonia Regional High School in Hillsborough. Quispamsis Middle School, \u00c9cole \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire Sacr\u00e9-Coeur and Happy Feet daycare in Grand Falls also confirmed positive cases on Sunday. Higgs reminded residents in the Tuesday briefing that even those who may not be at risk of serious illness from COVID-19, can put others at serious risk. \u201cThis is a critical point for New Brunswick. Government can put more and more measures in place but the reality is they will only work if we all agree to follow them.\u201d \u201cAct like you have the virus, so stay at home, keep distances, don\u2019t put yourself in a way that you can harm someone else,\u201d Higgs said. \u201cDon\u2019t take chances.\u201d Dr. Russell met with municipal and provincial officials in Saint John and Moncton on Monday. Before Tuesday\u2019s press conference, Moncton Mayor Dawn Arnold said she believes the purpose of the visit was to \u201cenlist the support of others to get the message across.\u201d \u201cWe are at a very critical point in this; we\u2019re at a tipping point,\u201d Arnold said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all put a lot into this, and I know people are frustrated, they\u2019re tired.\u201d She said many people\u2019s livelihoods are at stake when it comes to increasing measures. \u201cBut this is so important right now, that we don\u2019t give up. We\u2019ve got to follow all of those guidelines.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Dr. Russell noted the three southern regions count for the majority of New Brunswickers \u2014 where people live and work \u2014 and said there would be both intended and unintended consequences with the stricter measures. But, she said the restrictions are necessary to help minimize the spread of COVID-19. Don Darling, the Mayor of Saint John, said he is trying to encourage people through the red phase. \u201cWe can get through it\u2026we can get through red. Red is not the red that it was before,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cLet\u2019s follow the directives, some of them (are) common sense: wearing our masks, and being as patient as possible. \u201cLet\u2019s push these 300 cases back down to zero,\u201d Darling said, \u201cand I\u2019m confident that we can get through it.\u201d"},

Scientists create a new flu vaccine every year, for instance, just to keep up. For SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes   the idea of a mutation is inherently scary for many people, but experts insist it\u2019s to be expected. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t What that might mean for vaccine effectiveness? At this point, not much, experts say. \u201cI don\u2019t want people saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to wait for my vaccine because I heard about this one mutation in England,'\u201d said Dr. Gerald Evans, chair of infectious diseases division at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ont. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to change anything. I don\u2019t suspect it will \u2014 most mutations don\u2019t \u2014 but time will tell.\u201d So far, there have been few variants of the new novel coronavirus \u2014 fewer than experts expected, in fact. The good news is that those variants have so far not been meaningful enough to affect the virus\u2019s behaviour or the vaccine\u2019s ability to ward it off. But any new mutation \u201cbears a little bit of watching,\u201d said Evans, including the recent discovery in the U.K. British scientists are trying to establish whether a surge of cases in southern England is   At this point, there\u2019s no evidence to suggest these mutations make the virus any more deadly, more transmittable, or capable of rendering the vaccine useless. But some experts say the types of these new mutations are noteworthy. Both mutations \u2014 \u201cN501\u201d and \u201cH69/V70 deletion\u201d \u2014 are found in the spike protein, which allows the coronavirus to infiltrate and hijack our body\u2019s cells. It could, in theory, result in COVID-19 spreading more easily between people. H69/V70 deletion is not a new mutation for COVID-19 \u2014 it\u2019s the same mutation that famously infected mink in Denmark. The concern here was that antibodies from the blood of those who recovered from COVID-19 were less effective at attacking that variant of the virus. N501, meanwhile, alters an important part of the spike known as the \u201creceptor-binding domain,\u201d which might make it easier for the virus to get inside. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cThat\u2019s important because when we\u2019re looking at neutralizing antibodies \u2014 that is antibodies that protect you from infection \u2014 there are some specifically directed at that spike protein, and in some cases, specifically to that receptor-binding domain. So when you make an antibody, it sort of blocks that area from attaching to you,\u201d said Evans, who also sits on the COVID-19 advisory council for Ontario. \u201cWe think that\u2019s the main vaccine strategy for preventing the virus from infecting you, but it\u2019s too early to know if it\u2019s going to cause any problems.\u201d While not impossible, mutations affecting the efficacy of vaccines is doubtful, according to Levon Abrahamyan, a virologist at the University of Montreal. Coronaviruses are genetically stable, he said, which means they mutate very slowly. Some experts estimate that the coronavirus accumulates  , which is considered to be about half the rate estimated for influenza. Essentially, in order to evade immunity, a virus is forced to change or replicate. When a virus tries to replicate, it collects errors or mistakes over time, according to Abrahamyan. These mistakes \u2014 i.e. accidental changes in its RNA \u2014 can become variants or mutations. They are less common in coronavirus than influenza, in part because of its proteins. COVID-19 proteins can essentially \u201cproofread\u201d which, in theory, means that it corrects mutations as they happen, therefore reducing the number of possible mutations. The flu virus does not have this built-in mechanism. That\u2019s good news where a vaccine is concerned, experts agree. So far, the genetic evidence about SARS-CoV-2 suggests that the frontrunner vaccines \u2014 Pfizer, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca \u2014 are unlikely to need much modification in the future because of the virus\u2019 relatively stable genome. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In other words, the original vaccine created to target COVID-19 should work in the long-run, said Abrahamyan. \u201cThe frequency of mutations in influenza is much, much higher than this new coronavirus,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a real danger to our vaccine development.\u201d Even then, new technology can back it up. The introduction of mRNA or messenger RNA technology into vaccine development was \u201crevolutionary\u201d to the success of the vaccines we see now, said Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease expert based out of Toronto General Hospital. The technology proved to be more potent and straightforward for Moderna Inc., which attributes its rapidly designed sequence for the vaccine to the technology. This same technology will help tackle any mutations discovered now or in the future, he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cIf there was a change to COVID-19, we could use the exact same technology to produce a new vaccine or modify existing platforms for vaccination,\u201d he said. Abrahamyan suggested a tweak for a mutation could be even quicker \u2014 \u201cmaybe one or two days.\u201d It\u2019s important to remember that \u201cmost mutations do nothing,\u201d said Bogoch. The majority of the mutations seen so far have had no apparent effect on the virus, and only a minority are likely to change the virus in any significant way \u2014 for example, making it more able to infect people, more likely to cause severe illness, or less sensitive to natural or vaccine-induced immune defenses. They don\u2019t tend to have a significant change to how this virus interacts with us, Bogoch added, but it\u2019s still important to \u201cnot sweep this under the rug.\u201d \u201cWhile we don\u2019t have all the information yet, these are answerable questions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the appropriate expertise to address them, and they\u2019re doing so.\u201d Rigorous analysis and experiments in a laboratory setting will be required to find out if these variants are more infectious or spread better than others. That\u2019s already underway in the U.K. In the meantime, there\u2019s no reason to panic, the experts agree. \u201cThe virus is doing what viruses do,\u201d said Evans."},

That brings the total number of cases in Manitoba to 243. There are now 143 active COVID-19 cases, while 96 people have recovered \u2014 those who have recovered from the illness or who have died are not included in the active caseload by public health. The province is now looking at procuring reusable masks within Manitoba, chief nursing officer Lannette Siragusa said Saturday, as a potential solution to the global shortage of N95 masks. The government issued a request for proposals Saturday for Manitoba manufacturers to produce the new reusable masks, after Health Sciences Centre surgeons and specialists designed a prototype. The new mask has a silicone base and uses an N95 or higher grade filter, according to the province. The province is willing to sign purchase orders totaling up to $15 million to pre-order the masks, the province wrote in a news release. Siragusa also said a number of private businesses have stepped in, donating much-needed medical supplies to the province. Anticipated shipments of personal protective equipment from the federal government have started, Siragusa said \u2014 on Wednesday she had warned Manitoba\u2019s multi-million dollar PPE order had only trickled, with a few hundred thousand dollars\u2019 worth of equipment arriving from the federal government despite the province putting in a supply order early. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The province recorded its fourth death related to the disease caused by novel coronavirus Friday, said chief public health officer Dr. Brent Roussin that day.

Eight people are currently hospitalized, including five in intensive care. Officials also announced six new cases Friday.

And one thing that we know about trauma is that while it\u2019s happening, you do whatever you can do to survive. \u201cYou bear down and you just get through it, which is what we\u2019re all trying to do right now. I think that we\u2019re still very much in the trauma phase \u2014 the active trauma phase of this pandemic.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t But what happens after physical-distancing measures are lifted? What comes after the pandemic is over and people are able to get back to whatever their normal may be? \u201cThere\u2019s going to be residual stress, depression, certainly financial pressures, learning how to re-engage with the world in this new way,\u201d Henick said. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna be difficult for a lot of people. And those are exactly the kinds of risk factors that lead to increasing rates of depression, anxiety and even suicide.\u201d Individuals had little time to prepare for, or even process, all the consequences of strict health measures put into place by countries to contain the spread of  : job losses, economic collapse and the complete uprooting of everyday life and relationships. For Maggie Hou, who has generalized anxiety disorder, staying at home and losing her support system has been very difficult. \u201cI shut down because I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m not prepared for this. I did not run a rehearsal of the situation in my head,\u201d the McMaster University student said. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting to not worry, because it is practically impossible for me to not worry.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Henick says for those who have  , the pandemic is exacerbating their symptoms. He is also concerned for those who have never had any mental health issues in the past and are now facing a life disruption without fully digesting the long-term impact it may have on them. A large body of scientific studies shows that there is a close relationship between indicators such as unemployment and mental health and suicide. In fact,\u00a0  that a one per cent increase in unemployment was accompanied by a one per cent increase in the rates of suicide in the U.S. Henick explains there is a peak-and-valley response in our nervous system when faced with trauma. Right now we are at a peak, in which we are engaging with the immediate threat of the pandemic. You go into survival mode, which can be very taxing on a person\u2019s mental health. \u201cAnd in fact, it doesn\u2019t actually let you think through or process what\u2019s happening to you. Its only interest is in getting and keeping you alive and keeping you safe,\u201d Henick said. Once the pandemic is over, there will be a valley, in which we recover from that threat. But the problem is, going back to baseline without support can take a lot longer than we may think. After the threat passes, Henick says people can start to retreat or fall into depression or find other ways of dissociating themselves with the trauma they experienced. \u201cOur mental illness can almost become an infection itself. So that\u2019s where the valley would come in. We peak from the emotional response to the immediate trauma, the fear, the anxiety, and then we retreat back and then hopefully we come back to normal,\u201d he added. \u201cBut not everybody does. Some people stay stuck either way at the top of that peak or they stay stuck down at the bottom or anywhere in between.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Hou says she\u2019s been feeling as though she is in a state of paralysis by her constant worry for the health and safety of her family and friends. She\u2019s not sure how she\u2019s going to handle re-integrating back into school and work. \u201cHow many breakdowns will I have? \u201cWhat about panic attacks and will I be able to go out into crowded places, even though coronavirus is not a problem any longer?\u201d Henick says there is evidence to suggest a mental health \u201cpandemic\u201d is coming after COVID-19, and is a real threat. In Canada, we currently have universal medical care, but things like psychotherapy, which Henick says has proven to be an effective treatment for mental health problems, generally aren\u2019t funded publicly. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Henick says the federal and provincial governments need to step up to make sure proper treatments and programs are funded so as many people as possible have access when in need \u2014 adding that everyone, including employers, will have a role to play. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for employers, in particular, to realize when we start to loosen some of the restrictions that we\u2019re currently facing that this needs to happen slowly, that we can\u2019t go back to the way the world was overnight,\u201d Henick said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Hou says she already knows she won\u2019t be able to go from zero to 100 right away and that she\u2019s going to need strong social supports in place to move forward. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m returning to work afterwards because of the coronavirus and will I be able to feel safe at work or school,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s my biggest fear right now. \u201cAnd I hope that with the virus slowly dying down, my social supports like psychiatrist, counsellor, therapist, I\u2019ll get those supports back slowly and help me with my current fears and uncertainties.\u201d Health officials caution against all international travel.

{"title": "What is the \u2018Swiss cheese model\u2019 and how can it apply to coronavirus? - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted October 13, 2020 1:57 pm", "body": "By now, the measures to protect ourselves during the   pandemic are engrained in our minds. But with \u201c \u201d an increasing concern, public health experts are reminding people of the importance of these measures using an unusual metaphor \u2014 cheese. The \u201cSwiss Cheese Model\u201d uses slices of cheese to visualize how interventions work together. Each intervention \u2014 including physical distancing, mask-wearing, hand washing and disinfecting \u2014 is depicted as an imperfect barrier to virus transmission by the holes in the cheese. When multiple effective, but imperfect, interventions are combined like a stack of Swiss cheese slices, some of the holes in the cheese are covered and virus transmission is decreased or even stopped. Some viruses might get through a couple of holes, but the odds are low that holes in every slice would line up and allow the virus to slip through the entire stack. \u201cThe beauty of this is that it shows every one of these interventions has strengths and weaknesses,\u201d said Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto. \u201cIt shows why you want multiple interventions. You want to pile them together.\u201d The model itself is nothing new. It was created in 1990 by James Reason, a professor at Manchester University, who wanted to shed light on human error and how mishaps could be prevented by \u201ca series of barriers.\u201d It\u2019s now used extensively in health care, risk management, aviation and engineering. Each layer of defence is broken down but linked together, showing that intervention at any stage could help stop a problem from unfolding. The theory shows \u201chow errors line up to cause big, catastrophic outcomes when there\u2019s a series of small mishaps that occur in a sequence,\u201d said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease specialist based out of Toronto General Hospital. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t We already apply it in other aspects of life, he said. Take driving, for example. Speed limits control how fast we drive, intersections are engineered for safety, seatbelts can help restrain us in a crash and airbags can help minimize injuries. None of these protections are perfect individually, but when combined, they help reduce the risks of driving. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to appreciate bundled approaches to risk mitigation,\u201d Bogoch said. \u201cSo if people aren\u2019t wearing masks and aren\u2019t distancing and aren\u2019t practising good hand hygiene, if all of these start to align, then the risk of acquiring COVID-19 goes up.\u201d The coronavirus version of the Swiss Cheese Model was adapted by Ian M. Mackay, a virologist in Australia. It made its way to Twitter this week, where public health experts from around the world hailed it as an effective way to visualize how an individual can help combat the spread of COVID-19. Mackay\u2019s iteration included seven cheese slices as interventions or barriers: physical distancing, ventilation, masks, hand hygiene, fast testing, contact tracing, and surface cleaning. Slightly updated to version 1.3  \u2014 \u026a\u1d00\u0274 \u1d0d. \u1d0d\u1d00\u1d04\u1d0b\u1d00\u028f, \u1d18\u029c\u1d05 \ud83e\udda0\ud83e\udd27\ud83e\uddec\ud83e\udd7c\ud83e\udd9f\ud83e\uddfb (@MackayIM)  It\u2019s the combination of \u201ccontact reduction\u201d interventions, like limiting gatherings, and \u201ctransmission reduction,\u201d like masking, that makes this work, according to Nicholas Christakis, a physician and sociologist at Yale University. \u201cNo matter the specific combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions, so long as a certain threshold is achieved, the pandemic can be brought to heel,\u201d he   on Oct. 11. \u201cOne just needs enough layers of Swiss cheese, but not necessarily all of them.\u201d \n\t\t\t \n\t\t In other words, Furness said, it comes down to the circumstances of transmission, which the model might not completely depict. It\u2019s not perfect, he added. \u201cEvery one of those arrows in those diagrams needs a narrative. Here\u2019s the vector, here\u2019s how illness gets from one person to another, and here is how distancing, cleaning, and handwashing either do or do not prevent that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are the situations that evade this?\u201d Mackay said that it\u2019s not necessary to get hung up on the order each protection or cheese slice is placed. \u201cIt\u2019s about the whole rather than any one slice,\u201d he  . The model also isn\u2019t made to be reversed, Bogoch said. \u201cAt the end of the day, this is a way to conceptualize protections at an individual level.\u201d He said these protections will all play a role in risk reduction for the foreseeable future, likely even after a vaccine is developed and distributed. The point of the model is to see these interventions as \u201ccomplementary, not substitutable,\u201d Furness said. \u201cVentilation and masks are not the same. They come at the problem in a different way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bargain. You can\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m not doing that, therefore I don\u2019t need to wear a mask.'\u201d Now that Canada and much of the world has passed a lockdown stage, there are more scenarios where a person can apply this model, he continued. He said Canadians can look at the model and simply ask themselves if the scenario they\u2019re about to take part in is safe. \u201cIn this sense, indoor dining would be clearly inappropriate. You\u2019re relying on the restaurant to do cleaning, you can do handwashing, distancing and masks are out the window, so that\u2019s bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gives you a sense of what risks are involved in a particular situation, and what slices of cheese fall off.\u201d"},

The testing centre does not require an appointment and works on a first come, first served basis. It is only accessible by car on weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Centre Pierre-Charbonneau on Viau Boulevard.

Caroline St-Denis, a director with the CIUSSS, said the clinic can see up to about 400 people per day at the moment and there are 30 employees on site. \u201cPeople really appreciated the testing in vehicles so we wanted to repeat the operation in terms of snow and rain,\u201d she said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Montrealers on foot or with reduced mobility who require a   test are being asked to opt for the Chauveau screening centre since the one at Centre Pierre-Charbonneau is hard to access on foot.

Montreal public health says a COVID-19 test is only required in one of the two following situations: a person has symptoms of the virus or has recently come into close contact with someone who has contracted it. Vincent Thiboutot says he showed up at the clinic after experiencing stomach pains. \u201cBetter safe than sorry cause if I have it, well, at least I know that\u2019s what I have and I\u2019ll act accordingly,\u201d he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The new centre comes as Montreal has seen a rise in new infections linked to the virus and a partial lockdown is underway until at least Oct. 28. Carole Boiry said she was pleased about the new site because it is closer to her home compared to the Chauveau testing location. After using the self-assessment tool online, she decided it would be best to get a test. \u201cThat is a good motivator   to have a place not far  I am very happy,\u201d she said.

{"title": "Can COVID-19 vaccines reduce transmission? Here\u2019s what we know so far - National | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted March 9, 2021 4:26 pm", "body": "If you have received the coveted     shot, there is both good and bad news. While there is a high probability you will not get sick with  , there is a chance you can still catch the novel coronavirus and in turn infect others. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \u201cVaccination doesn\u2019t prove that you are immune,\u201d said Alberto Martin, professor of immunology at the University of Toronto. Canada has so far approved  . During the global clinical trials, the shots from Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson showed high efficacy rates \u2013 ranging from 62 per cent to 95 per cent \u2013 in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 illness. But there are still many unanswered questions about whether the vaccines can also suppress transmission \u2013 that is, keep vaccinated people from acquiring the virus and spreading it to others. There are a number of ongoing studies looking at the effectiveness of the vaccines on transmission \u2013 and preliminary data is promising. According to a   in The Lancet medical journal \u2013 not yet peer-reviewed \u2013 the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine was shown to reduce the rate of positive PCR tests by half when two doses were given. There was a 67 per cent reduction after one dose. A study by Cambridge University in the U.K. suggests that a\u00a0 \u00a0of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can reduce fourfold the number of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections.\u00a0  released on Feb. 26 are yet to be peer-reviewed. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Meanwhile,  \u00a0published in the\u00a0  on Feb. 18 found an 85 per cent reduction in symptomatic COVID-19 infections within 15 to 28 days of receiving a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, with an overall reduction in infections, including asymptomatic cases detected by testing, of 75 per cent. These are encouraging signs for ending the pandemic, as preventing infection in those who have been vaccinated means there is no virus that can be passed on to others. If you never get infected, then it\u2019s also possible that you won\u2019t transmit it to other people,\u201d said Gerald Evans, an infectious disease specialist at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ont. Pfizer is currently testing a subset of Phase 3 trial participants to look for evidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. \u201cUnderstanding whether the vaccine can stop the transmission of the virus will be an important tool for the continued rollout of the vaccine and to inform public health planning efforts and recommendations,\u201d Christina Antoniou, director of corporate affairs of Pfizer Canada, told Global News in an emailed statement. 4) Most vaccines reduce the likelihood of both disease and infection but do a better job at preventing disease. \u00a05) Often people think that if they're vaccinated they won't get sick and they can\u2019t infect other people, but this isn't always the case. \u2014 Soumya Swaminathan (@doctorsoumya)  According to the  , there is limited evidence about the performance of the COVID-19 vaccines to prevent infection or transmission. However, it is \u201creasonable to assume there will be some level of protection against transmission,\u201d the U.N. health agency said in an emailed statement to Global News. Evans said while more data is needed to determine the vaccination\u2019s impact in real-world settings, he believes vaccines are the \u201cnumber one tool\u201d at our disposal and will substantially curb COVID-19 spread. I\u2019m estimating about 75 to 80 per cent reduction in transmission,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to be able to go into a post-pandemic world.\u201d Martin is also confident that vaccines will stop the spread of COVID-19 or any other disease, for that matter. Once you establish immunity to a specific virus, you can no longer transmit it,\u201d he said. He explained that the immune memory established by the vaccine prevents the virus from producing billions of viral copies needed for a person to become infectious. \u201cSo you yourself are protected and you protect others around you,\u201d he said. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t There is also evidence that the viral load, which determines how much virus you can emit when you cough, breathe or sneeze, is significantly lower when you are vaccinated. Results of a   done in Israel \u2014 not peer-reviewed \u2014 suggested that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can reduce the viral load for infections by fourfold 12 to 28 days after the first dose is given. \u201cThese reduced viral loads hint to lower infectiousness, further contributing to vaccine impact on virus spread,\u201d the authors said. Evans said this is important because high viral loads are not just associated with more severe disease but also with a higher risk of transmission. \u201cIf the infection you get is associated with a really low viral load, then that means the likelihood that you\u2019re going to go on to transmit it to somebody else is significantly and dramatically reduced.\u201d"},
{"title": "Premier Jason Kenney declares COVID-19 public health emergency in Alberta  | Globalnews.ca", "publish_time": "Posted March 17, 2020 2:04 pm", "body": "Premier Jason Kenney declared a state of public health emergency in Alberta over the novel   on Tuesday. Kenney said the decision came after a meeting with the emergency management committee Monday night. At a news conference on Tuesday afternoon, Alberta\u2019s chief medical officer of health said the province has 23 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, bringing the total up to 97 and up from 74 a day earlier. Here is how the cases break down by age, according to Alberta Health: \u2022 Age 80+: 0 \u2022 Age 65-79: 10 \u2022 Age 55-64: 13 \u2022 Age: 35-54: 44 \u2022 Age 25-34: 13 \u2022 Age 20-24: 2 \u2022 Age 15-19: 3 \u2022 Age 10-14: 4 \u2022 Age 5-9: 3 \u2022 Age 1-4: 5 \u2022 Under one year: 0 \u201cOne of the critical things \u2014 I\u2019d talked before about some of the community-acquired cases we\u2019d seen and we have seen a few more cases that we\u2019re still investigating but that are concerning,\u201d Dr. Deena Hinshaw told reporters when asked why she recommended that the government declare a public health emergency on Tuesday. \u201cI anticipate having more information tomorrow to share about those. \u201cBut it does seem to me that we are seeing a few more instances where community transmission is possible. In addition, we\u2019re seeing examples such as the dental conference that I referenced before, and we now have six cases in Alberta alone from that one dental conference. Hinshaw referenced the importance of \u201cflattening the curve\u201d while responding to the reporter. \u201cI believe the time is right to really set us up for success because I think if we wait until we\u2019re overwhelmed and then declare, it\u2019s a little late when we could do it proactively,\u201d she said. The province is moving forward with aggressive new measures on social distancing, including banning gatherings of groups of 50 or more. Existing events should be cancelled immediately, he said. Citizens are also banned from public places like casinos, bingo halls, theatres, children\u2019s play centres, recreation centres and arenas, science centres, museums and art galleries, community centres, fitness facilities, and entertainment facilities like movie theatres. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Kenney also advised that family events such as weddings and funerals of more than 50 people should be cancelled, as should concerts and religious gatherings. Until further notice, all Albertans are restricted from attending bars and nightclubs. Hinshaw acknowledged that the measures would be hard on some Albertans but noted that she believes they are necessary to slow the spread of novel coronavirus. \u201cThese are aggressive steps that we do not take lightly but these are necessary to keep us all healthy and safe,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only means we have to keep the virus from spreading is to limit contact between people. \u201cThe more we can slow the spread of the virus down, the less likely it is that there will be a surge of cases that overwhelm our health system\u2019s capacity to care for those that need hospitalization or intensive care.\u201d Hinshaw said of the 97 cases, five involve hospitalizations and two people are in intensive care. She said all other cases involve people self-isolating and where full recoveries are expected. Of the 97 cases in Alberta, 70 are in the Calgary zone, 20 in the Edmonton zone, three in the Central zone, three in the North zone and one in the South zone. The ban does not apply to health care facilities, grocery stores, airports, the Alberta legislature, and other essential services. Sit-down restaurants, caf\u00e9s, coffee shops, food courts and other food-serving facilities, including those with a minors-allowed liquor license, are limited to 50 per cent capacity to a maximum of 50 people. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t Restaurant take-out, delivery or drive-through service is permitted. Licensed facilities will also be permitted to deliver liquor. Kenney said the Provincial Operations Centre was tracking supply chains there was no reason to be worried about food shortages and advised against hoarding. \u201cThere is no logical reason for people to go out and buy weeks and weeks \u2014 or months \u2014 of supplies.\u201d Kenney commended some stores, like Shoppers Drug Mart and Sobeys, for introducing earlier store hours specifically for seniors to shop. \u201cI would ask all retailers to consider having a dedicated, safe and orderly time when seniors and the vulnerable can access what they need.\u201d The elderly are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19. \u201cWe are also, as I said, working with charities to see if they can step up deliveries \u2014 complimentary deliveries \u2014 to the homes of seniors for pharmaceuticals, cleaning equipment, food and other necessities,\u201d Kenney said. Non-profit, religious and community soup kitchens are also exempt, as are homeless shelters. Kenney said the province was working with the shelters on a plan for those facilities. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t The province has only ever enacted a state of emergency twice:   and during the southern Alberta floods in 2013. Declaring one gives the government far-reaching powers so it can take centralized control in a crisis, enact emergency plans and order the evacuation of people, livestock and personal property. Declaring a public health emergency also gives the chief medical officer of health, who is Alberta\u2019s top doctor, greater powers, Kenney said. That could include bringing nurses or doctors out of retirement, Kenney explained. \u201cWe have been briefed that the single greatest concern in the future \u2014 in coping with the peak time in the pandemic \u2014 will be around the availability of trained personnel. \u201cThe chief medical officer and Alberta Health Services may need extra authorities for scheduling: perhaps to bring back medical professionals who have retired recently, or to cancel vacation time.\u201d Kenney said everyone understands during a pandemic there will be a peak demand for health care, and Tuesday\u2019s move aims to plan for that to avoid facilities exceeding capacity. \u201cThese are the kinds of authorities that are presented in the   through the declaration of a public health emergency that will give certainty of our ability to provide the medical care that Albertans will need.\u201d Hinshaw said AHS is now postponing all scheduled and elective surgeries. Urgent and emergency surgeries as well as oncology treatment and scheduled cesarian procedures will continue, however. She said AHS will contact Albertans scheduled for procedures and reschedule as soon as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s a necessary step to ensure the health system can sustain its pandemic response and be able to respond to emergencies,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cWe will get through this together but we need your help and support by following these orders and all other public health guidance. \u201cI cannot stress this enough: we must all take measures to improve sanitization and cleanliness,\u201d she said, while also reminding Albertans to stay home and self-isolate if they don\u2019t feel well and to make every effort to practice social distancing. \u201cNew public health measures under this state of emergency will limit the time Albertans spend in large crowds and crowded spaces,\u201d she noted. On Tuesday, the province said Alberta\u2019s Provincial Operations Centre has also been elevated from a level three to a level four, the highest level. Kenney said he visited the centre Monday night and was impressed with the staff. \u201cI know that this province is resilient and we are ready for the test,\u201d Kenney said. \u201cI have full confidence in our public health and safety officials and we will continue doing everything in our power to contain the outbreak and keep Albertans safe.\u201d Municipalities, charitable and non-profit organizations providing social services support will immediately see $60 million to support their COVID-19 response, the province said. The government said the funding will be provided to adult homeless shelters, women\u2019s emergency shelters and the Family and Community Support Services program, which supports municipalities and civil society organizations in providing services to vulnerable Albertans. Hinshaw said Tuesday that health officials have learned things from past pandemics and are trying to apply that knowledge to the present situation where possible. \u201cWe\u2019d be making predictions based on that past experience, knowing that this is the first time in recorded history that we have had a coronavirus pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we\u2019re making inferences from what we\u2019ve seen in influenza pandemics, which I think is reasonable \u2014 there\u2019s similarities in some of the mechanisms of spread, but again, knowing that we can\u2019t make perfect predictions.\u201d Hinshaw spoke about the 2009 pandemic, the year there was an H1N1 outbreak. \u201cOver the summer\u2026 perhaps, if this is the same as previous pandemics, we may be able to ease off a little bit, but we\u2019ll need to be ready in the fall for the possibility that it could come back again and have plans to deal with it at that point.\u201d On Tuesday night, a spokesperson for DyanLIFE confirmed to Global News that the lab services company had been forced to close some of its locations in Alberta. They said the closures are the result of staffing issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with some employees either staying home with children because classes have been cancelled or self-isolating after returning home from a trip. They said the closures have nothing to do with any confirmed or presumptive cases of COVID-19 at the DynaLIFE locations themselves. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel  , causes only mild or moderate symptoms for most people, such as fever and cough, but severe illness is more likely in the elderly and people with existing health problems."},
